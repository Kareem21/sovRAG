# File Notes
File notes are notes related to the selected file, and can be used to 
 remind you of tasks that you need to perform, such as making a telephone 
 call on a certain date concerning an issue.

File notes can be created using the File Note button in the Ribbon or 
 through the File Notes screen and can be set up:

	

- With an action due date, so that it appears in the Reminders 
    	 as an outstanding task until it is completed.

	

- Linked to a checklist, so that you can keep track of the steps 
    	 that need to be performed until a particular task is completed.

	

- As a recurring event.

File notes can be created through File Notes &amp; Saved Checklists 
 screen, using the File Note button from the Ribbon, as well as the File 
 Notes tab. Any of these method will create a file note for the selected 
 Master File. To create multiple file notes with checklist for more than 
 one Master File, refer to [Create Option](file:///c:/temp/0457b882-c844-4314-8878-ce1a9c2207bd/input/Create_Option.htm).

## File Notes &amp; Saved Checklists screen

 and edit file notes. You can access Files Notes screen in File Maintenance 
 screen: click General &gt; To Do &gt; Master File &gt; Folders &gt; File 
 Notes &amp; Saved Checklists.

# Excel Statements
Similar to Word Reports, Excel Statements are also based on templates 
 that are created using Microsoft Excel. A pre-designed library of statements 
 is provided for your usage, which you can customise to suit your needs. 
 If you have the authority to do so, you can also create your own statements.

Excel Statements can also be seen in both Viewpoint - Home and File 
 Maintenance screens

&nbsp;
## Correspondence Icon from the Ribbon
This method allows you to create correspondence in the form of a Microsoft 
 Word file or e-mail. When you select the icon, it opens up the Correspondence 
 window allowing you to create the correspondence by:

	

1. Selecting the [template](javascript:TextPopup(this)).
    
    	<div class="droptext" id="POPUP609546982" style="display: none;">
    		If the correspondence is to be an e-mail, you can:
    		
        			    - choose Create e-mail [without template]
        			    - select an e-mail template
        			    - select a Word template and convert to e-mail by ticking 
        			 the Convert Document to e-mail option
        		
     </div>

	

1. Entering information for the required [fields](javascript:TextPopup(this)).
    
    	<div class="droptext" id="POPUP609666518" style="display: none;">
    		Depending on the template, you may need to complete or update 
    		 the following details:
    		
        			    - Sender - this defaults to the selected Master File and 
        			 is editable when the template contains the code (+HD.EntCode+).
        			    - Handled by - this defaults to the user generating the 
        			 correspondence and is editable when the template contains 
        			 the code (+HD.UserHandling+).
        			    - Addressee - if the template does not contain the code 
        			 (+HD.AddrCode+), this field is not active.
        			    - Subject/Reference - if the template does not contain 
        			 the code (+HD.CorRef+), this field is not active.
        			    - Document Date - this defaults to today's date. If the 
        			 template does not contain the code (+HD.DateDocument+), this 
        			 field is not active and cannot be edited.
        		
     </div>

	

1. Add [attachments 
    	 and/or e-mail addresses](javascript:TextPopup(this)).
    
    	<div class="droptext" id="POPUP609694793" style="display: none;">
    		If the output is an e-mail, you will be able to:
    		
        			    - click Attachments tab to add file(s) as attachment(s) 
        			 for the e-mail.
        			    - click E-mail Addresses tab to specify e-mail addresses 
        			 for the recipients either by selecting the listed e-mail addresses 
        			 or entering the addresses manually.
        		
     </div>

	

1. Click Generate.

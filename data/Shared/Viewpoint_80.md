# Viewpoint 8.0
Viewpoint is a comprehensive entity and wealth management solution that is made up of four integrated areas of functionality.

&nbsp;
### Entity Administration
Entity Administration is an easy-to-use and intuitive entity management solution designed for accurate data capture and the efficient handling of company secretarial duties, including the generation of statutory forms and reports. The various screens can be assigned for use according to entity type, hence you only capture the appropriate and relevant data for that entity. Add-on sub-modules such as Annual Fees allow you to record simple invoicing details such as annual recurring fees so that you can generate invoices to your clients from here.

&nbsp;
### Practice Management
Practice Management consists of three elements: the Sales Ledger, the Purchase Ledger and Time &amp; Disbursements. Each of these is designed to provide the necessary tools for accurate handling of customer invoicing, time charging and recovery operations. VAT/GST/Sales Tax and exemptions are fully supported, as are recurring, fixed and ad-valorem fees.

&nbsp;
### Accounting
Accounting is designed to handle multi-currency transactions for an unlimited number of entities. The program has a universal account group structure, which is the backbone of the system. All Chart of Accounts templates are based on the account group structure and these Chart of Account templates can easily be copied and tailored. You can set up different Chart of Accounts templates for different types of entities. Further customisation can be done for an individual Account File if necessary.

The use of provisional journals (draft journals) is optional for each file, and account balances are updated after each posting of either a provisional/draft journal or a regular journal. The program comes installed with various statements and reports, which you can customise.

&nbsp;
### Document Management
Document Management caters for document storage and retrieval as well as document generation and workflow management. The usage of tags on Viewpoint templates allow you automatically store Viewpoint-generated documents with minimal data input. In addition to the storing capability in Microsoft Word, Excel and Outlook, Document Management also allows for the storing of files in any format by virtue of a drag and drop feature.

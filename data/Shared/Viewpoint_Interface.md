# Viewpoint Interface
There are two main types of screens in Viewpoint:

	

- Viewpoint - Home - This screen is seen when you log in to the 
    	 program. It is the starting point and provides a global view that 
    	 is not specific to a Master File. For configuration-related screens 
    	 and functions in Viewpoint - Home screen, access should be restricted 
    	 only to users who will be empowered to change the environment's configuration.

	

- Master File screens - These are screens that are seen after 
    	 you have selected a Master File. There are two such screens:

	

- 
    - 
        		
        
    - [File Maintenance](file:///c:/temp/0457b882-c844-4314-8878-ce1a9c2207bd/input/File_Maintenance_screen.htm) 
        		 - This allows for maintenance of the Master File where you may 
        		 add, edit or delete data, based on your access rights. Screens 
        		 available here may or may not contain grids. You need to select 
        		 a Master File first before you can open its File Maintenance screen.  
        &#13;&#10;		  
        &#13;&#10;		<span class="hcp3">Note</span>: 
        		 If you do not have access to the Master File, you will not be 
        		 able to open its File Maintenance screen.
        
        
        		
    - [File Enquiry](file:///c:/temp/0457b882-c844-4314-8878-ce1a9c2207bd/input/Enquiry_-_File_Enquiry.htm) - 
        		 This is strictly read-only so no data input or changes can be 
        		 done. Like File Maintenance screen, you must also select the Master 
        		 File first in order to open its File Enquiry screen.
        
        
        	

There is another type of screen known as Enquiry screens which are similar 
 to File Enquiry in the sense that you cannot make any data changes. These 
 are:

	

- [Relations Enquiry](file:///c:/temp/0457b882-c844-4314-8878-ce1a9c2207bd/input/Enquiry_-_Relations_Relation.htm) 
    	 - This is used to display relations for the selected Master File.

	

- [Ownership Enquiry](file:///c:/temp/0457b882-c844-4314-8878-ce1a9c2207bd/input/Enquiry_-_Ownership.htm) - This 
    	 is used to show the ownership structure of the selected Master File.

	

- [Billing Enquiry](file:///c:/temp/0457b882-c844-4314-8878-ce1a9c2207bd/input/Billing_Enquiry_screen.htm) - This 
    	 is used to view details of the selected Billing File.

	

- [Account Enquiry](file:///c:/temp/0457b882-c844-4314-8878-ce1a9c2207bd/Client_Accountant/Account_Enquiry.htm) 
    	 - This is used to view accounting details of the selected Account 
    	 File.

	

- [Documents 
    	 Enquiry](file:///c:/temp/0457b882-c844-4314-8878-ce1a9c2207bd/Document_Manager/Documents_-_Enquiry.htm) - This is used to view documents stored for the selected 
    	 Master File.

 Enquiry, the following elements are available for the types of screens:

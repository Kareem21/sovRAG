- Viewpoint Reports [V] - These are reports that are provided 
    	 by Viewpoint and they are non-customisable.

	

- SSRS Reports [S] - These can be SSRS reports that you create 
    	 yourself and place in Viewpoint so that they can be generated from 
    	 Viewpoint

    	 reports allow for data to be presented differently for summarising 
    	 and analysis, similar to Microsoft Excel's PivotTable and PivotChart.

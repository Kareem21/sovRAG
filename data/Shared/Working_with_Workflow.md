# Working with Workflow
A workflow is a series of sequential steps for a process. You can use 
 workflow to depict the work that has to be performed for a process so 
 that you can monitor who was assigned and what has been completed thus 
 far.

In order to make use of workflow, you have to:

	

1. Create the workflow template.

	

1. Start the workflow for the Master File.

	

1. Update the workflow.

Once you have started a workflow, if necessary, you can also link the 
 workflow to information related to the workflow. This is done by linking 
 the workflow to the screen containing the information using [Workflows 
 tab](file:///c:/temp/0457b882-c844-4314-8878-ce1a9c2207bd/input/Tools_Workflows_Tab.htm).

&nbsp;

Creating Workflow Template

The workflow template must first exist before you can use make use of 
 it. Creation of workflow templates are to be done in Workflow Library 
 screen.

&nbsp;

Start Workflow

You can start a workflow for a Master File by:

	

- Clicking Workflow button in the Ribbon.

	

- Clicking New in General &gt; To Do &gt; Action Items &gt; Workflows 
    	 screen.

You will be presented with a list of available workflows in the [Select 
 Workflow screen](file:///c:/temp/0457b882-c844-4314-8878-ce1a9c2207bd/input/Select_Workflow_Screen.htm).

After you have selected the workflow, the Workflow screen will be displayed 
 where you will be able to see the following:

	

- [Auto-Save](javascript:TextPopup(this))
    
    	<div class="droptext" id="POPUP539433678" style="display: none;">
    		Click this button to save the workflow automatically after every 
    		 entry. This button will always be on if the 'Auto-Save Workflow 
    		 Changes' option in System Defaults - General/Master File is ticked. 
    		 
    		<span class="hcp3">Note:</span> 
    		 Disabling the Auto-Save feature for a workflow can be done by 
    		 clicking the Auto-Save button in workflow. This applies only to 
    		 the workflow at that point in time. The next time you open the 
    		 workflow, the Auto-Save function will be enabled again. If you 
    		 wish to disable the Auto-Save feature for all workflows, untick 
    		 the 'Auto-Save Workflow Changes' option in Configuration &gt; 
    		 Settings &gt; [System 
    		 Defaults &gt; General/Master File](file:///c:/temp/0457b882-c844-4314-8878-ce1a9c2207bd/Configuration/System_Defaults_-_General_Master_File.htm).

    	 screen accessed through macro will be in read-only mode and the command 
    	 buttons on the screen will not be shown as no actions are allowed 
    	 on this screen.  
    &#13;&#10;

    	 is updated. Users can use the Workflow tab that is located at the 
    	 bottom of the screens in File Maintenance to access the workflows 
    	 that are configured with a macro that updates the information to the

            			 as 'Complete with Next Step' . Click this to go to the subsequent 
            			 step. If the value in the subsequent step is 'Read-Only', 
            			 step status is 'In Progress' and has been saved, the value 
            			 will be automatically refreshed when the value in the previous

    	 be ticked by default. Ensure that these remain ticked if you want 
    	 them deleted.

	

- Linked items that cannot be deleted will be unticked by default 
    	 and you will not be able to select the checkbox.

[Can I undo 
 a step?](javascript:TextPopup(this))
 
<div class="droptext" id="POPUP399834126" style="display: none;">
	

Yes, this is possible. To do so, click Undo Step from the Ribbon.

The Undo Step button will be active only if the user has authority 
	 level 6 - Regular User or level 8 - Power User for the Workflow screen

The workflow owner can undo every step in the workflow while the 
	 step owner can only undo their respective step.

	

<span class="hcp3">Note</span>: 
	 If the workflow status is 'In progress', undoing a step will remove 
	 all information within the step. However, if the step includes time 
	 entries, disbursement entries and document holders created previously 
	 in the step will remain. 

	

If the workflow status is 'Completed', undoing a step will reset 
	 the workflow status to 'In progress'. Information for all steps will 
	 be retained. &nbsp;

	

You may be prompted with a New Task screen which will create a task 
	 for undoing the step. Review the task details and click Update. If 
	 mandatory fields from the task are not completed, a warning message 
	 will be prompted detailing the task number, task description and status 
	 of the task. 

	

If the workflow consists of change links, undo will be restricted 
	 and a warning message will be prompted when you attempt to undo the 
	 step.

# Password Protection
Password can be set on PDF files generated in Viewpoint 8.0 to protect the files' contents. When a password is set, the file can only be opened if the right password is entered. If the password is incorrect, users will be informed so that they can try again.

The password is stored in the registry and can be set for PDF files generated through the following processes:

- 
    
    Copy Document

- 
    
    Mail Document

- 
    
    E-mail Bin

- 
    
    Convert and add as PDF

- 
    
    Export search result

- 
    
    Binders


Password is set in the Viewpoint PDF Document Printer screen which can be accessed through:

- 
    
    Viewpoint tab &gt; User Options &gt; General.

- 
    
    PDF Printer Properties button in Ribbon.

- 
    
    Viewpoint Add-In Options screen.

# Dashboard Screen
The Dashboard screen contains widgets that you can add to display information 
 in a graphical manner such as pie chart, column chart or even a world 
 map. Depending on whether the Dashboard screen is in ViewpoInt - Home 
 or within a Master File screen, the types of available widgets will differ. 
 In Viewpoint - Home, the Dashboard screen also contains the main filter 
 which allows for the information included in the Dashboard screen to be 
 filtered by selected administrator, Administrator Group, User Group, Organisational 
 Unit or User Relations.

The contents of the Dashboard Screen can be changed by clicking on Edit.

## Modifying Dashboard Screen
By default, widgets are added o the Dashboard screen through [Windows 
 Menu](file:///c:/temp/0457b882-c844-4314-8878-ce1a9c2207bd/Configuration/Settings_-_Windows_menu.htm) or [Dashboard 
 Widgets](file:///c:/temp/0457b882-c844-4314-8878-ce1a9c2207bd/Configuration/Dashboard_Widgets.htm). However, you can choose to add or remove widgets from the 
 Dashboard screen by clicking Edit and this will show the following:

	

- [Add/Remove 
    	 Widget](javascript:TextPopup(this))
    
    	<div class="droptext" id="POPUP532377306" style="display: none;">
    		The list of available widgets for the screen is shown. To include 
    		 it, tick the Show checkbox and click OK.
    		If the Mandatory checkbox is ticked, you will not be able to 
    		 remove the widget.
    		&nbsp;
    		<span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">Note</span>: 
    		 The list of widgets is based on the widgets made available for 
    		 a User Group.
    		&nbsp;
     </div>

    	<div class="droptext" id="POPUP532593030" style="display: none;">

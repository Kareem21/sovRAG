## Adding Hyperlinks to Help Text
Users can navigate to a URL from the Help tab after placing a hyperlink 
 in the Help Text. This hyperlink can only be clicked from the Help tab, 
 not the Help Text in the grids (hyperlinks are displayed as normal text). 
 URLs are opened using the machine's default web browser. <span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB">Hyperlinks must be in the following format:</span>

&nbsp;

<span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB">&lt;html&gt;&lt;a 
 href="section 1"&gt;section 2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</span>

&nbsp;

Format explanation:

	

- Section 1 is the URL for the link, example 
    	 https://www.goviewpoint.com/. This must be an absolute URL that includes 
    	 http:// or https:// parts.

	

- Section 2 is the displayed caption of the 
    	 hyperlink. For example, if the value for section 2 is 'Visit Viewpoint', 
    	 the hyperlink will be displayed as Visit Viewpoint instead of https://www.goviewpoint.com/.

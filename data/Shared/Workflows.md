# Workflows
The Workflows feature in Viewpoint allows for work to be assigned and 
 performed in a predefined order. This is done by creating the workflow 
 template and then launching it when necessary.

Once a workflow has been launched, its progress can be viewed through 
 the following screens:

	

- Workflows - This shows workflows that have been launched.

	

- Workflow Steps - This shows the current step for a workflow 
    	 that has been launched.

&nbsp;
## Workflows Screen
The Workflows screen displays workflows that have been launched for 
 a Master File and includes workflows started through Viewpoint Engage 
 where they are known as requests.

This screen can be accessed through:

	

- Viewpoint - Home screen - Click Home &gt; To Do &gt; Action 
    	 Items &gt; Workflows.

	

- File Maintenance screen - Click General &gt; Action Items &gt; 
    	 Workflows.

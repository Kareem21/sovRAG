# Viewpoint Tasks
Tasks in Viewpoint are work to be completed that can be assigned to either a Master File or a document file. When a task is assigned, the task creator and assignee can view them in the following screens:

In Viewpoint - Home screen:

- 
    
    [Tasks](file:///c:/temp/0457b882-c844-4314-8878-ce1a9c2207bd/Document_Manager/Home_-_Tasks.htm) - This shows pending tasks that have been assigned.

- 
    
    [Tasks Created by (Me)](file:///c:/temp/0457b882-c844-4314-8878-ce1a9c2207bd/Document_Manager/Home_-_Tasks_Created_By_(Me).htm) - This shows tasks that have been created.


In File Maintenance screen:

- 
    
    [Tasks Outstanding](file:///c:/temp/0457b882-c844-4314-8878-ce1a9c2207bd/Document_Manager/File_-_Tasks.htm) - This shows pending tasks for the Master File.

## Assigning Master File Task
A Master File task means the task is for a specific Master File. This type of task may be assigned as a stand-alone task or it may be assigned as part of a checklist or workflow step. For the former, this can be done by clicking on the Task icon in the Ribbon. For the latter, this means the task is an item in the checklist or workflow step.

<span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">Note</span>: To assign a Master File task for more than one Master File, refer to [Create Option](file:///c:/temp/0457b882-c844-4314-8878-ce1a9c2207bd/input/Create_Option.htm).

## Assigning Document Task
A document task is linked to a document in Viewpoint. This requires the document to be in a document holder placed in either the In-tray or stored in a filing cabinet.

To assign a document task, you need to first locate the document holder. If the document has been stored, you can use [Document Search](file:///c:/temp/0457b882-c844-4314-8878-ce1a9c2207bd/Document_Manager/Document_Search.htm) or [Documents Enquiry](file:///c:/temp/0457b882-c844-4314-8878-ce1a9c2207bd/Document_Manager/Documents_-_Enquiry.htm). Once you have located the document holder, click Add icon from the Ribbon or right-click on the document and click Add Task.

If the document holder is in the [In-tray](file:///c:/temp/0457b882-c844-4314-8878-ce1a9c2207bd/Document_Manager/In_tray.htm), select the document holder from the In-tray screen and click Add Task.

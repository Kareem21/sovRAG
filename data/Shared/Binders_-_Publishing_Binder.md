# Publishing Binder
Documents that are added into the Binder will be seen in the Binder's 
 Folders tab. In the Folders tab, select the document that you would like 
 to bind by checking on the checkbox in the column Bind. The documents 
 that have been checked will be listed in the Bound Documents tab.

You can re-arrange the documents, insert groups, adding notes and specify 
 the format for the documents in the Bound Documents tab. You can also 
 remove a document from the Bound Documents tab by right clicking on the 
 document and select Unbind Document from the context menu.

Once you are satisfied, you can publish the document by clicking on 
 the Publish button. You will be advised of the status at the bottom of 
 the screen. The published document will be shown in the Published tab.

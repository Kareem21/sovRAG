# Master File Search
To select a Master File, you can perform a search to ensure that it 
 exists. In Viewpoint - Home screen, you can:

	

- click the Search icon in the Home tab of the Ribbon

	

- click Search in the Section Menu under the Home tab, To Do section

Either of the above will bring you to the Master File &gt; Search screen 
 where you will see:

	

- Master File Selector tool

	

- Master File lists - Recent tab, Favourites tab, My Files tab

	

- Search tab

	

- Advanced Search tab

If the Master File exists, then you can select the Master File and open 
 its File Maintenance screen. Otherwise, you would create a [new 
 Master File](file:///c:/temp/0457b882-c844-4314-8878-ce1a9c2207bd/input/New_Master_File.htm).

&nbsp;
## Master File Selector Tool
This is located under the Breadcrumb where you can search for a Master 
 File by:

	

- entering the Master File code in full or partially with the 
    	 prefix '+' &nbsp;e.g. +BARCVI

	

- entering the Master File name in full or partially e.g. Bright

	

- clicking on the magnifying glass icon at the end to open the 
    	 [Select Master File](file:///c:/temp/0457b882-c844-4314-8878-ce1a9c2207bd/input/Select_Master_File_screen.htm) screen

	

- pressing F12 to open the [Select 
    	 Master File](file:///c:/temp/0457b882-c844-4314-8878-ce1a9c2207bd/input/Select_Master_File_screen.htm) screen

If you have entered at least three characters and Auto Suggest is enabled, 
 up to 10 matching results will be displayed for you to select. Otherwise, 
 press TAB or F12 key to see results for your input.

To look for a Master File where the name contains a word, use an * e.g. 
 *Bank will return Master Files where the name contains the word 'Bank'.

When you have selected the Master File, it will be shown in the Master 
 File Selector tool so you can click Open File to open its File Maintenance 
 screen.

&nbsp;

<span class="hcp2">Note</span>: Auto 
 Suggest can be enabled or disabled through [User 
 Options](file:///c:/temp/0457b882-c844-4314-8878-ce1a9c2207bd/input/User_Options.htm).

&nbsp;

    	 as Entity Files. When this is selected, then the status refers to 
    	 the Entity File status.

    	 up as Account Files. When this is selected, then the status refers 
    	 to the Account File status.

    	 up as Billing Files. When this is selected, then the status refers 
    	 to the Billing File status.

	

- Supplier Files&nbsp;- this will include only files that are 
    	 set up as Supplier Files. When this is selected, then the status refers

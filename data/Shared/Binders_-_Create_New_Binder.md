# Create New Binder
New binders can be created in a number of ways but regardless of the 
 method, you will see a separate Binder screen which allows you to specify 
 the binder details, add documents and specify the publishing option.

&nbsp;
## Binder Screen
This screen is used to add and publish documents in your binder.

&nbsp;

Ribbon

This contains general functions as well as binder-specific functions 
 classified in these groups:

        			<div class="droptext" id="POPUP511110844" style="display: none;">
        				The only button here is to access the Viewpoint PDF 
        				 Printer and set up or change the [properties](javascript:TextPopup(this)) 
        				 for the Viewpoint PDF Printer.

        The Viewpoint PDF Printer is only for use within Viewpoint to convert 
         documents to PDF files. The properties allow you to set the following:
            
            	        - Paper size - Select the paper size for the resulting PDF files.
            	        - Use Viewpoint PDF Printer (smaller file size) - If you have 
            	 Office 2007 and above, Microsoft PDF Printer is used by default. Tick 
            	 this to use Viewpoint PDF Printer instead for creation of smaller 
            	 PDF files from Viewpoint. Note that this is not applicable for conversion 
            	 to PDF through Word add-ins.
            	        - Embed Fonts in PDF File - Tick to include all font information 
            	 so that your documents will look the same after conversion. If you 
            	 do not embed fonts, font substitution will be performed when the font 
            	 used in the document is not available on your computer. This can result 
            	 in significant differences.
            	        - Other options 
            	
                		        - 
            - For next PDF File only - Select this if you want to apply 
                		 the password and/or watermark settings to the next PDF file created.
                		        - 
            - Save for all - Select this if you want to apply the password 
                		 and/or watermark settings for all PDF files created in Viewpoint.
                		        - 
            - Set Password - Tick to set password for PDF files created 
                		 in Viewpoint. See also [Password 
                		 Protection for PDF Files](file:///c:/temp/0457b882-c844-4314-8878-ce1a9c2207bd/input/Password_Protection_for_PDF_files.htm).
                		        - 
            - Print Watermark - Tick to include watermark to the PDF files.

# Change Processing Screen
This screen is seen when a change occurs or when you choose to retrigger 
 a change from the Changes screen. The Change Processing screen will show 
 you items linked to the change so that relevant items can be selected 
 for the change.

The screen contains three columns:

	

- Change - within this column are linked items categorised by 
    	 type.

	

- Select - this denotes whether or not the item is selected for 
    	 creation/generation. You can configure for the item to be automatically 
    	 selected or not when you set up the change link through Selection 
    	 field.

	

- Effective Date/Action - this list the effective date of the 
    	 change as well as the default action for the item. The action can 
    	 be define when you set up the change link using tag values:

	

- 
    - 
        		
        
    - For documents (forms and reports), the default action is 
        		 'Queue' where the document will be sent to either the Form Queue 
        		 or Document Queue.
        
        
        		
    - For other items like task, checklist and workflow, the default 
        		 action is 'Prompt' which means that the items is shown in the 
        		 screen and you can click on the Browse button in the Effective 
        		 Date/Action column to select the item and enter details for the 
        		 items.
        
        
        	

&nbsp;

For example, the screen below shows four form templates, one task, one 
 Word report and one workflow linked to the change 'New Bank Account':

 but can be changed by clicking on the date and either typing over or selecting 
 the date from the calendar:

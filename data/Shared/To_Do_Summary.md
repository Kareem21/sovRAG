# To Do Summary
The To Do Summary screen gives a summarised view of items requiring 
 attention from the user. It also functions like a collective screen allowing 
 you to create (except for Obligations), edit or delete the items without 
 going to the individual screen for the item.

You can access the screen through:

	

- Viewpoint - Home screen - Click Home &gt; To Do &gt; Overview 
    	 &gt; To Do Summary

	

- File Maintenance screen - Click General &gt; Overview &gt; To 
    	 Do Summary

When accessing the Dashboard, you will see that it is divided into two 
 parts - a summary showing the total pending and the item list.

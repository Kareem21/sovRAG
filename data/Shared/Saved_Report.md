# Saved Report
This screen is customisable and allows for SSRS and Analysis reports 
 to be added so that the reports are displayed when you access the screen. 
 The customisation is possible as long as you have access to the Saved 
 Report screen.

By default, there are four blank cells in a two-by-two configuration 
 where each cell can contain one SSRS or Analysis report. If necessary, 
 more rows can be added. To customise the screen, right-click on the screen 
 and the following options are seen:

    		When using Pixels, this will set the row height to a fixed number 
    		 of pixels where a value of 250 means the cell will have a height

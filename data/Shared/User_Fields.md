# User Fields
When the fields in Viewpoint are not enough, you can consider using 
 user fields to create additional fields to store information for the following:

	

- Master Files

	

- Identity Details

	

- Entity Files such as Companies, Trusts, Funds and Partnerships 
    	 as well as specific share classes and fixed assets

	

- Billing Files and Matters

	

- Account Files, sub-ledger accounts and portfolios

User fields allow you to specify the field type and can also be retrieved 
 in reports. 

Most user field types have their own screens and values are added to 
 the user fields in the screen. However, user fields for shares, fixed 
 assets, Matters, sub-ledger accounts and portfolios are accessed through 
 the User Fields command button in Shares &gt; Capital screen, Fixed Assets 
 screen, Matters screen, sub-ledger screens and Portfolios screen respectively.

&nbsp;
## User Field Screens
The User Fields screens are for user field types with their own screen 
 where you will see:

&nbsp;

File Properties list

This is a list of options which is to be configured in File Properties 
 [FP_x] [lookup tables](file:///c:/temp/0457b882-c844-4314-8878-ce1a9c2207bd/Configuration/Lookup_Tables.htm) 
 (where x is the file type). If there is nothing configured, then this 
 list is not seen. You can use this to specify the characteristics of a 
 particular file and tick values that apply to the file. The values that 
 are ticked are saved with the selected Master File.

&nbsp;

User Field list

This list user fields that have been added for the Master File.

&nbsp;

        			 the information. If you click Cancel at this point, the information 
        			 entered in Step 2 will not be saved.
        		
     </div>

- <span class="hcp2">Retrieve</span> - Click this 
    	 to [retrieve](javascript:TextPopup(this)) 
    	 user fields or templates. This is required if the user field is not 
    	 automatically added.
    
    	<div class="droptext" id="POPUP417866897" style="display: none;">
    		
        			    1. Click Retrieve.
        			    1. There are two tabs in the User Field/Template Selection 
        			 screen:

            				        - User Fields.
            			
        			    1. Select the template or fields that you want from the 
        			 list and click Select.
        		
     </div>

	

- <span class="hcp2">Format</span> - Click this 
    	 to [format](javascript:TextPopup(this)) 
    	 the user fields. Formatting includes re-arranging the fields and creating/customising 
    	 templates.
    
    	<div class="droptext" id="POPUP417876294" style="display: none;">
    		User fields can be grouped together to create templates. This 
    		 simplifies the process of retrieving and formatting the fields, 
    		 and is useful to avoid picking up the wrong fields or forgetting 
    		 the right ones. It also allows you to group blocks of information 
    		 together.
    		
        			    1. Retrieve the user fields you need for the template.
        			    1. Once the user fields are listed, click Format.
        			    1. All the fields that have been selected will show in 
        			 the Format User Fields box.
        			    1. Re-arrange the fields as necessary and add lines to 
        			 describe the group so that it is easily identified. If any 
        			 of the lines are not required for the template, you need to 
        			 exit this screen and delete the field first, then begin the 
        			 process again.
        			    1. Enter the name of the template and click Save as Template.
        			    1. Click Update to update the arrangement of the user fields 
        			 in your screen as well.

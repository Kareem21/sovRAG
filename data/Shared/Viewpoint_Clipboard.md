The Viewpoint Clipboard is similar to the Clipboard function in Windows 
 where it is a 'container' for copied information. Viewpoint Clipboard 
 allows users to copy and paste information to fields in standard Viewpoint 
 screens. The information can be copied from workflow steps, from grid 
 records, Address Cards as well as from Viewpoint screens.

 Clipboard. However, in order to paste, you must have at least authority

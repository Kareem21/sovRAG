# Local Address Card
If you need to keep the address details in the local language as well 
 as in the main language (usually in English), then you can turn on the 
 Local Address feature. To do this:

	

- Tick the Enable 'Local Address Cards' in [System 
    	 Defaults &gt; General/Master File](file:///c:/temp/0457b882-c844-4314-8878-ce1a9c2207bd/Configuration/System_Defaults_-_General_Master_File.htm).

	

- Add the language option to the Address Local Settings [ADLS] 
    	 [lookup table](file:///c:/temp/0457b882-c844-4314-8878-ce1a9c2207bd/Configuration/Lookup_Tables.htm).

Once you have local address card feature turned on, you will see the 
 local address fields and details in the following areas:

	

- Address Card Master

	

- Addresses screen

	

- Custom Report

&nbsp;
## Address Card Master - Edit/New Address
With Local Address Card feature turned on, when you create a new Address 
 Card, you will see the following:

	

- Local Address - select the option for the address card.

	

- 
    - 
        		
        
    - Not required - This is the default setting. Select this 
        		 if the address does not require the address details in the local 
        		 language.
        
        
        		
    - Same as main address - Select this if the address details 
        		 in the local language is the same as the main language.
        
        
        		
    - Other language options - This are languages added to the 
        		 Address Local Settings [ADSL] lookup value. Select the relevant 
        		 language.
        
        
        	

	

- Duplicates of the address fields - each address field now has 
    	 two text boxes - one for the main language and the other for the local 
    	 language. If you select 'Not required' or 'Same as main address', 
    	 then the text boxes for the local address will not be enabled. If 
    	 you choose a local language, then the text boxes are enabled for you 
    	 to enter the information.

 screen. If you are creating a new address card, you can enter the local 
 address at the same time.

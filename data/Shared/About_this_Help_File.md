This help file is designed to be as user-friendly as possible and to provide the most useful information on a particular screen or field using Viewpoint-standard descriptions and captions.

In all other instances, please select Help Contents from the Viewpoint tab.

The help file is arranged according to the Section Menu and screens, so that you may easily find a particular topic. There may be instances in your environment where a field or screen is re-captioned, or the purpose of the field re-designated. In these instances, please refer to your System Manager for guidance. In cases where a field or screen is hidden, please ignore the mentions in the help file.

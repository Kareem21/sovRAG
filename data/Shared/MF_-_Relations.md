# Relations - Master File
The relations set up here are those that are connected to the selected 
 Master File and should not be confused with the Statutory Officers, such 
 as Directors or Secretaries, of an entity. For example, if the information 
 was relevant or required, this is where you would record an individual's 
 family members. This screen may be disabled for entity files.

It is also possible to set up reciprocal relations for Master File relations. 
 This will enable the second relation to be created automatically. For 
 example, if the reciprocal relation for 'Parent' is 'Child', when a Parent 
 relation is created, a 'Child' relation in the related Master File will 
 also be created.

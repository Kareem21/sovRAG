# Service Office
Specific functions and access rights to Master Files can be given to a select group of people or administration group. This gives you better control over who is allowed to view, update and delete information on specific Master Files. This screen is used when you use the Service Office security model.

There are two sections in this screen and you can click on:

- 
    
    ![](../image307.gif) - To minimise this section and hide the command buttons. In the grid, only the selected row will be seen.

- 
    
    ![](../image308.gif) - To expand the section and show the command buttons.

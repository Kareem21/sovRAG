# Overview Screen
The Overview screen by default contains the Navigation Listing widget 
 and an overview of information relating to the selected area. 

The Navigation Listing allows you to access other screen and function 
 where you can:

	

- see headings in blue with icon - you can click to hide/show 
    	 items 

	

- see screen/function denoted by a screen icon - you can click 
    	 on the screen/function to access it. If there is a linked workflow, 
    	 this will be shown when you mouse over it. You can click on the linked 
    	 workflow to start it.

You can choose to add or remove widgets from the Dashboard screen by 
 clicking Edit and this will show the following:

    	 Widget](javascript:TextPopup(this))
    
    	<div class="droptext" id="POPUP532377306" style="display: none;">

    		 it, tick the Show checkbox and click OK.

    		&nbsp;

     </div>

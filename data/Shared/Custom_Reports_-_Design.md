You can create a new custom report or edit an existing custom report 
 in the Design folder.

This defaults to the name of the selected report.

&nbsp;

Selection criteria

If the design of the report contains conditions, this is seen here.

&nbsp;

Report list

This contains the available categories and reports that you can select.

&nbsp;

Fields list

This contains fields for the selected report which are grouped accordingly. 
 You can click on the +/- sign next to the group to expand or collapse 
 the group.

To add a field to the report, tick the checkbox for the field. To add 
 all fields within a group to the report, tick the checkbox for the group 
 and the fields will be added in the order listed within the group. Once 
 a group has been selected, you can still untick the checkbox for a field 
 if you wish to exclude only that field.

 is not possible to select fields from different reports to include in 
 your new custom report design.

&nbsp;

Fields that are selected appear as columns in here. The order of the

# Merge
If there are address cards with the same address details, you can merge 
 these to maintain data integrity. Note that you need authority level 8 
 - Power User to do this.

	

1. In Address Card Master, search for the addresses to be merged 
    	 in [Find Address](file:///c:/temp/0457b882-c844-4314-8878-ce1a9c2207bd/input/Address_-_Find_Address.htm).

	

1. In [List](file:///c:/temp/0457b882-c844-4314-8878-ce1a9c2207bd/input/Address_-_List_Link.htm), tick the address 
    	 cards you want to merge.

	

1. Click Merge.

	

1. In the Merge section, you will see all selected address cards. 
    	 At this stage you should carefully review if all listed Address Cards 
    	 are actually the same address and are to be merged. If there are Address 
    	 Cards that should not be merged, you should do this activity again 
    	 from the beginning.

	

1. Click to select the address card that will remain, i.e. all 
    	 other addresses will be merged to this address. An arrowhead will 
    	 appear next to the checkbox.

	

1. Tick the checkbox for all other address card to merge.

	

1. Click Merge!

	

1. Click Yes to confirm. Reminder: You CANNOT undo the merging.

	

1. On completion of merging, the system will ask if you wish to 
    	 delete the merged address cards. Click Yes. These Address Cards no 
    	 longer have any links to their Master Files as the links have now 
    	 been changed to the merged Address Card.

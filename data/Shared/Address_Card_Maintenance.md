- [Find Address](file:///c:/temp/0457b882-c844-4314-8878-ce1a9c2207bd/input/Address_-_Find_Address.htm) - This 
    	 is used to search for an address. It is advisable to search for an 
    	 address before you choose to create a new address card to avoid duplicate 
    	 entries.

    	 - This allows you to create new address cards or edit existing ones. 
    	 You will not be able to select this without performing an Address 
    	 Card search first.

	

- [Where used](file:///c:/temp/0457b882-c844-4314-8878-ce1a9c2207bd/input/Address_-_Where_used.htm) - This shows 
    	 the links for the selected address card.

	

- [Merge](file:///c:/temp/0457b882-c844-4314-8878-ce1a9c2207bd/input/Address_-_Merge.htm) - This is only available 
    	 when you launch Address Card Master from Viewpoint - Home &gt; Administrator 
    	 &gt; Address Card Maintenance.

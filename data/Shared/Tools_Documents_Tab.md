# Documents Tab
When a document is stored, you can link the document holder to the screen 
 or record in the screen (if the screen has grids). This allows for quick 
 retrieval of the document. The linking can be done in this tab, where 
 you have the following:

&nbsp;

Grid

This shows the name of the selected grid. For screens without any grid 
 or with just one grid, the value is fixed. For screens with multiple grids,

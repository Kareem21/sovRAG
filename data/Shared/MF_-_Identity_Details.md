# <span class="Bold">Identity Details</span>
This is only available if you tick Identity Details in Setup. Information 
 entered here is used for statutory and primary due diligence purposes. 
 If your Master File is an entity, this folder will contain entity-related 
 fields. If the Master File is an individual, this folder will contain 
 fields that relate to an individual. Information entered in Incorporation 
 No., Date of Incorporation and Place of Incorporation fields will be updated 
 to the following screens:

	

- File Maintenance &gt; Entity Administration &gt; General.

	

- File Maintenance &gt; Entity Administration &gt; Statutory.

<span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">Note</span>: Ensure 
 that you enter a valid jurisdiction name for Place of Incorporation field. 
 This is to avoid invalid code when the information is updated to the screens.

Before creating a new address card, it is recommended that you first 
 perform a search to ensure the address details do not already exists in 
 the database. This is to avoid having multiple address cards with the 
 same address details.

Changes made to identity details will require you to confirm the Effective 
 Date of the change. If you change the information for a Master File which 
 acts as an officer for an entity, you will be prompted to file the changes. 
 When the option 'Trigger Global Change of Particular for Shareholders' 
 in Configuration &gt; Settings &gt; [System 
 Defaults &gt; Entity/Forms](file:///c:/temp/0457b882-c844-4314-8878-ce1a9c2207bd/Configuration/System_Defaults_-_Entity_BPM.htm) is enabled, then this prompt is also seen 
 if the Master File is a shareholder.

# Add Document to Binder
Adding documents to the binder can be done either as you are creating 
 the binder or after you have created the binder. If it is the latter, 
 you need to open the binder that you want first. This can be done either 
 through Binders screen or [Binders tab](file:///c:/temp/0457b882-c844-4314-8878-ce1a9c2207bd/input/Tools_Binders_Tab.htm). 
 For Private Binders, this can only be done in the opened Private Binder 
 screen.

However, note that the documents must be stored. If it is a new document 
 that has not been stored, when adding the document, you will be asked 
 to create a holder for the document. These holders can be manually indexed 
 or you can set up folders in the binder with predefined indexing.

&nbsp;
### New documents

	

1. Click New/Paste Document.

	

1. Enter details for the new document holder:
    
    	
        		
        
    - Select the filing cabinet.
        
        
        		
    - Complete the index fields.
        
        
        	

	

1. Drag and drop the document to the holder. Or you can right-click 
    	 in the holder's index field and select Add File(s) or paste a copied 
    	 document. &nbsp;

	

1. Click Store.

	

1. Repeat steps 1 – 4 until you have added all the necessary documents.

If the binder contains folder(s), you can click to select the folder 
 and skip step 2. For information on setting up binder folders, refer to 
 [Setting 
 up Folder](file:///c:/temp/0457b882-c844-4314-8878-ce1a9c2207bd/Document_Manager/Binders_-_Setting_up_Folder.htm).

Alternatively, you can also select the file and copy it by using right-click 
 and Copy or pressing Ctrl+C. Using this method, when you click New/Paste 
 Document, the document is already inserted to the new document holder. 
 This way, you can skip step 3.

If you are able to see document file, you can also drag and drop the 
 file to the document list.

&nbsp;
### Stored documents
If the documents have been stored, you can perform a search for the 
 document holder and use the Add to Binder option. Alternatively, if you 
 have created the binder, you can search and select the document from within 
 the binder screen. This option is not available for Private Binders. &nbsp;

	

1. In the Binder screen, click Documents from the Ribbon to search 
    	 for the document. This launch the Documents Enquiry.

	

1. Right-click on the document and select Add to Binder.

	

1. Select the binder that you want.

	

1. Click Select.

	

1. Repeat steps 1 – 4 until you have added all the necessary documents.

Master File

A Master File is like an electronic business card or entry in an address 
 book. As with a conventional business card file or an address book, the 
 Master File is a central data storage area for your business contacts, 
 which you enter, refer to and update as required. All information entered 
 into a Master File will apply throughout the system. If you intend to 
 work on an existing Master File, you must select the file before any of 
 the menu items related to that file will be displayed. The screens and 
 functions you have access to will depend on your user roles.

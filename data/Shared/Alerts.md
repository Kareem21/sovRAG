# Alerts
A Master File can be flagged so that a user is alerted to take extra 
 steps or precautions whenever the Master File is accessed. The alert message 
 is displayed if the Master File is accessed, i.e. seen when the File Maintenance 
 screen is opened.

Otherwise, in the Viewpoint - Home screen, when you click on a Master 
 File from the Master File list, if an active alert is set up, the Info 
 Pane contains an additional Alerts tab. You can click on this to view 
 the alert message.

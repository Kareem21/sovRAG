## Overwriting Existing Favourite Reports
### Word Reports, Excel Statements, Standard Reports
Each favourite report must have a unique name. If the favourite report’s 
 name is already in use, saving will prompt the option to overwrite the 
 previous save. The names are unique to each report type. This means that 
 users can have, for example, the same name for a favourite Word Report 
 and a favourite Excel Statement.
### &nbsp;
### Custom Reports
For Custom Reports, overwriting an existing favourite report is only 
 allowed when adding new Custom Reports as favourite. If an existing favourite 
 Custom Report is renamed with another favourite Custom Report’s name, 
 then the overwrite will not work.

&nbsp;
### Reports from Saved Report Screen
All reports added from Saved Report screen cannot be overwritten. Users 
 also cannot remove the reports from the ‘Add to Favourite’ screen. To 
 remove the report from the Favourite Report Listing, you must remove the 
 widget from Saved Report.

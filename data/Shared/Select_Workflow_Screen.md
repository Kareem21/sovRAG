Filters

There are three available filters which can be collapsed or expanded. 
 
&nbsp;

Select

The options available are:

	

- Recent - when you select this, the workflow list will show up 
    	 to 20 workflows that you have recently started. 

	

- Favourites - when you select this, the workflow list will show 
    	 workflows that have been flagged as Favourite. 

	

- Library - when you select this, the workflow list will show 
    	 all workflows in your Viewpoint environment that you can access. This 
    	 selection can be further refined by the next filter.

Categories

The options available are categories that have been set up in the Workflow 
 Categories [WFCA] lookup table. You can select more than one and your 
 selection will filter the workflow list accordingly. If you select All, 
 then all options will be ticked. 

<span class="hcp3">Note</span>: When 
 you select an option for this filter, the Select filter will be set to 
 Library.

&nbsp;

View Options

At the moment, there is only one option and it determines whether or 
 not the Note column is seen in the workflow list. If this is ticked, the 
 Note column is seen.

&nbsp;

Search function

This allows you to search for workflows by typing in a search text. 
 Workflows with description matching the search text will then be displayed 
 in the workflow list. Up to 20 recent search text entered will be stored 
 and displayed when you enter new search text that corresponds with previous 
 ones.

<span class="hcp3">Note</span>: When 
 you use the Search function, the Library option is used. 

&nbsp;

Grid Details

This tab will show the details of the selected workflow. If no workflow 
 is selected, the tab will be empty.

&nbsp;

Workflow list

This shows workflows that you can select and the content depends on 
 the filter(s) applied or if the search function was used. In the list, 
 the description of the workflow is seen and if Show Note option is ticked, 
 the Note column is also included. To select a workflow, click on the workflow. 
 For the selected workflow, these icons are available:

	

- Red cross icon - this is seen only when Recent filter is selected. 
    	 Clicking this removes the workflow from the Recent list. 

	

- Empty star icon - click on this to add the workflow as a Favourite.

	

- Blue star icon - click on this to remove the workflow as a Favourite.

&nbsp;

Command buttons

Click on the relevant command button to perform the necessary.

	

- Select - Click this to start the selected workflow.

	

- Cancel - Click this to close the screen without starting any 
    	 workflow.

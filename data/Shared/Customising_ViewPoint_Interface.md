There are slight customisations that is possible for the Viewpoint interface.

&nbsp;
## Colour
The colour of the interface can be changed in terms of:

	

- the environment background colour - this affects the background 
    	 of the Section Menu and breadcrumb and is a global setting. You can 
    	 set different colour for different environment to easily differentiate 
    	 them.

	

1. 
    1. 
        		
        
    1. In Viewpoint - Home screen, go to Configuration &gt; Settings 
        		 &gt; System Defauts &gt; General/Master File.
        
        
        		
    1. In the Environment Colour Code, click on the Browse button 
        		 to select the colour.
        
        
        		
    1. Click OK.
        
        
        		
    1. Click Update. The change will take effect in the next login 
        		 session.

    	 and is a local setting i.e. you can change it for yourself without 
    	 affecting your colleagues.

            				        - Show Above the Ribbon
            			
        		
     </div>

## Ribbon
The Ribbon can be customised by adding new items to it or changing the 
 display of the interface:

	

- [Add 
    	 items from Section Menu to the Ribbon](javascript:TextPopup(this))
    
    	<div class="droptext" id="POPUP551977601" style="display: none;">
    		The icons in the Ribbon are pre-determined but it is possible 
    		 for you to add items from Section Menu to a new tab in the Ribbon:
    		
        			    1. Right-click on the item in the Section Menu.
        			    1. Click Add to Ribbon.
        			    1. In the Add to Ribbon window, you can modify the default 
        			 caption or change the icon.
        			    1. Click OK.
        		
    		This will add the Favourites tab. To make changes to this tab, 
    		 use Manage Favourites in Viewpoint tab.
     </div>

	

- [Simplified 
    	 view of the Ribbon](javascript:TextPopup(this))
    
    	<div class="droptext" id="POPUP551997386" style="display: none;">
    		You can switch to a simplified view of the Ribbon by clicking 
    		 the caret icon (^) at the lower-right edge of the Ribbon. The 
    		 simplified Ribbon displays buttons in a single line and reduces 
    		 the size of the button icons. Buttons that extend the Ribbon margin 
    		 are grouped in a drop-down list that can be displayed by clicking 
    		 the ellipsis icon at the right end of the simplified Ribbon. 
     </div>

&nbsp;
## Section Menu
The Section Menu is placed on the left of the screen and can be pinned 
 in place so that it is fixed in place. If you would like a bigger workspace 
 area, you can un-pin the Section Menu so that it slides out of sight.
<div>
<p class="hcp4"><img src="../Image%204.png" alt="" width="13" height="13" border="0" class="hcp5"> - This indicates the item is pinned. Click to un-pin.</p>
<p class="hcp4"><img src="../Image5.png" alt="" width="14" height="13" border="0" class="hcp5"> - This indicates the item is not pinned. Click to pin.</p>
<p class="hcp4">&nbsp;</p>
</div>
The width of the Section Menu can be changed as well by placing your 
 mouse on the border and click-and-drag to resize. The size of sections 
 within the Section Menu can also be resized using click-and-drag on the 
 border as well. 

&nbsp;
## Working Area
This part is fixed but you can increase it slightly by:

	

- [Minimising 
    	 the Ribbon](javascript:TextPopup(this))
    
    	<div class="droptext" id="POPUP458115489" style="display: none;">
    		
        			    1. Right-click anywhere on the Ribbon.
        			    1. Click Minimize the Ribbon.
        		
    		&nbsp;
     </div>

	

- [Hiding 
    	 the Section Menu](javascript:TextPopup(this))
    
    	<div class="droptext" id="POPUP458142317" style="display: none;">
    		Click on the pin icon on the top of the Section Menu to un-pin 
    		 it.
    		Once un-pinned, the Section Menu will only be seen when you 
    		 mouse over its tab(s).
     </div>

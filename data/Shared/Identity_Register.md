# Identity Register
This 
 feature requires Entity Administration component to be included in your 
 licence.

&nbsp;

The Identity Register screen allows for multiple identity types to be 
 recorded. The screen complements the Identity Details screen and is also 
 available only when the option Identity Details/Register is ticked in 
 the Master File Setup screen. Information from this screen can be configured 
 to update fields in either CDD or Identity Details screen by using [tags](file:///c:/temp/0457b882-c844-4314-8878-ce1a9c2207bd/Configuration/Identity_AEOI_Register_Type_-_Tags.htm). 
 
&nbsp;

<span class="hcp1">Note: </span>Identity 
 Details will still be the screen where information is retrieved from for 
 statutory forms and registers.

&nbsp;

Filter

The filter applies to the Identity Register list where you can choose 
 to view only active records, inactive records or both.

# Reviews
It is important to conduct reviews on Master Files to ensure that the 
 information is up to date. To ensure the reviews are carried out, you 
 can use Reviews screen to record the reviews that are necessary and results 
 from the reviews. The screen can be accessed through:

	

- General &gt; Master File &gt; Folders &gt; Reviews for Master 
    	 Files that are not managed entities.

	

- Entity Administration &gt; Initiate/Report &gt; Reviews for 
    	 Master Files that are managed entities.

Information for this screen can be populated manually or automatically 
 using [File Review](file:///c:/temp/0457b882-c844-4314-8878-ce1a9c2207bd/input/File_Review_Function.htm) function. There 
 are three sections in this screen and you can click on:

# Checklist
Checklists in Viewpoint 8.0 can be any of the following:

	

- Simple step listing that is viewed through Checklist tab in 
    	 Tools (Menu Checklist).

	

- Item list for File Notes (File Note Checklist).

	

- Step for a workflow (Workflow Step).

If necessary, you can also create one checklist and allow it to be a 
 combination of the above. For example, you can create a checklist as a 
 Workflow Step as well as make it a File Note Checklist.

&nbsp;
### Menu Checklist
As a simple step listing, the checklist can be a step-by-step guide 
 for users and attached to a menu screen. For example, you can set up a 
 checklist to show what needs to be done for a statutory officer appointment.

The presence of the checklist will be indicated by a number next to 
 the screen name. Users can then click on Checklist tab in Tools to view 
 the checklist items.

In this guise, users can refer to the steps but there it is not possible 
 to enter information to checklist. However, if necessary, users can link 
 the checklist to a File Note by clicking the File Note button.

<span class="hcp3">Note</span>: The 
 number will indicate the number of checklists attached to the screen. 
 When there is more than one checklist, in the Checklist tab, the titles 
 of all attached checklists will be displayed. Click on a checklist title 
 to display its items.

### File Note Checklist
In the event where you require information to be stored for work assigned, 
 you can link a checklist to File Notes. This can be done either through 
 the Checklist tab in Tools (as seen previously) or you can click on the 
 File Note button in the Ribbon.

Doing so will display the File Note screen with the checklist items 
 on the bottom portion of the screen. Information entered for the checklist 
 items in this instance, will be retained after you click Update.

<span class="hcp3">Note</span>: If 
 the option Closed/Locked is ticked, you will not be able to edit the checklist 
 items. To unlock, you need to have Level 8 Authority.

&nbsp;

To view or edit the details, in File Notes, select the File Note and 
 click Edit with Checklist.

### Workflow Step
As a workflow step, the checklist becomes an individual item that is 
 part of a whole so a number of checklists need to be created as steps 
 for one workflow template.

However, for each of the step, it is still possible to have item list 
 to record information similar to File Note Checklist. The items are seen 
 on the right side of the Workflow screen.

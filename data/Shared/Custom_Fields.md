# Custom Fields
Custom fields refer to user-defined fields which can be added to the 
 various General screens such as:

	

- Master File's General screen (<span class="hcp2">File 
    	 &gt; General &gt; Master File &gt;</span> <span class="hcp3">[Master 
    	 File]</span> <span class="hcp2">&gt; General</span>).

	

- Entity File's General screen (<span class="hcp2">File 
    	 &gt; Entity Administration &gt;</span> <span class="hcp3">[Jurisdiction 
    	 - Entity Type]</span> <span class="hcp2">&gt; General</span>).

	

- Billing File's General screen (<span class="hcp2">File 
    	 &gt; Sales Ledger &gt; Billing File &gt;</span> <span class="hcp2">General</span>).

	

- Supplier File's General screen (<span class="hcp2">File 
    	 &gt; Purchase Ledger &gt; Supplier File &gt;</span> <span class="hcp2">General</span>).

	

- Account File's General screen (<span class="hcp2">File 
    	 &gt; Accounting &nbsp;&gt; Account File &gt;</span> <span class="hcp2">General</span>).

These fields allow for additional information to be entered and is similar 
 to User Fields except for the fact that they are located in General screens 
 and not User Field screens. Changes made to Custom Fields will also be 
 recorded in the Change Log. These fields can also be included in [Confidential 
 Database](file:///c:/temp/0457b882-c844-4314-8878-ce1a9c2207bd/input/Confidential_Database.htm) so that they are encrypted.

Custom fields are to be managed in Configuration &gt; Settings &gt; 
 Customise &gt; [Field Settings](file:///c:/temp/0457b882-c844-4314-8878-ce1a9c2207bd/Configuration/Field_Settings.htm).

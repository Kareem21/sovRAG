<h1>Presenter Information</h1>
<p>In certain jurisdictions, the statutory forms require details of the 
 presenter such as the name and address. If there is only for presenter 
 for all managed entities, then the presenter can be specified in the Presenter 
 field in <a href="../Configuration/System_Defaults_-_Entity_BPM.htm">System 
 Default &gt; Entity/BPM</a>. However, if there are different presenters 
 for different jurisdictions, then tags can be added for the jurisdiction 
 in the Country Codes [CNTR] lookup table. The tags will allow for the 
 following:</p>
<ul class="hcp1">
	<li><p>different presenters for different managed entities in the jurisdiction</p></li>
	<li><p>same presenter for all managed entities in the jurisdiction</p></li>
</ul>
<p>In Viewpoint's standard statutory form templates, the presenter information 
 that is retrieved will depend on the jurisdiction of the entity where 
 the system will check if there is a tag added for the jurisdiction. If 
 there is no tag added, then the presenter will still be the one defined 
 in System Default &gt; Entity/Forms. However, if tag has been added, then 
 the information will be according to the tag.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">Note</span>: The 
 jurisdiction can refer to either where the entity is incorporated, or 
 where the entity has a foreign registration. This depends on whether the 
 form template is linked to Country of Incorporation or Country of Registration. 
 </p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<h2>How it Works</h2>
<p>Two tags are available:</p>
<ul class="hcp1">
	<li><p>PRESENT.RELTYPE</p></li>
	<li><p>PRESENT.MFCODE</p></li>
</ul>
<p>When retrieving the presenter information for an entity, the system 
 will check if the jurisdiction contains tag for presenter. If both tags 
 are added, the system will retrieve the presenter information based on 
 PRESENT.RELTYPE tag first. If this is not available i.e. there is no relation 
 for the entity, then it retrieves the presenter based on PRESENT.MFCODE 
 tag. This means that even within one jurisdiction, depending on the entity, 
 it is possible to have the presenter either as an appointed relation, 
 or a defined Master File.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<h2>Different Presenter for Different Managed Entities</h2>
<p>When there is a need to have a different presenter for different managed 
 entities in a jurisdiction, there must be a relationship type for presenter, 
 and presenter must be appointed for the managed entities. Then, ensure 
 that the [PRESENT.RELTYPE=&lt;RelCode&gt;] is added for the jurisdiction 
 in the Country Codes [CNTR] lookup table with the &lt;RelCode&gt; being 
 the code of the relationship type for presenter. </p>
<p>If the entity does not have an active appointed presenter, then presenter 
 will refer to the one defined in System Defaults &gt; Entity/Forms.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<h2>Same Presenter for all Managed Entities</h2>
<p>If the presenter is the same for all managed entities in the jurisdiction, 
 then you only need to add the [PRESENT.MFCODE=&lt;MFCode&gt;] is added 
 for the jurisdiction in the Country Codes [CNTR] lookup table with the 
 &lt;MFCode&gt; being the code of the presenter's Master File.</p>

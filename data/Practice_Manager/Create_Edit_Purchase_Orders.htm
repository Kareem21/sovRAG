<h1>Create/Edit Purchase Orders</h1>
<p>Purchase orders are written authorisations for certain parties to provide 
 goods or services at a specified price. Once a purchase order has been 
 accepted by the supplier and you are billed for it, you can then post 
 the order to an invoice.</p>
<p>A purchase order is a draft invoice (debit or credit) that has not yet 
 been posted to the invoice ledger. As a result, it is possible to edit 
 or delete purchase orders without affecting this ledger.</p>
<p>When the option 'Require Approval - Purchase Order' is enabled in Practice 
 Management system default setting, the approved purchase order will be 
 assigned with an invoice number and cannot be deleted. It will prompt 
 the user to set the invoice line as '0' value if user clicks the Delete 
 button. When this option is not ticked, all the Purchase Orders entries 
 are approved by default, however the draft invoice will not be assigned 
 with an invoice number and can be deleted.</p>
<p>Once the purchase order has been posted as an invoice, it is no longer 
 possible to edit or delete the invoice - instead a debit note must be 
 issued to offset any errors.</p>
<p>The Create/Edit Purchase Orders screen is where you create, edit, delete 
 and post purchase orders. This screen is automatically displayed if you 
 click Copy PO from Purchase Ledger &gt; Supplier Invoices in <a href="../Shared/Billing_Enquiry_screen.htm">Billing 
 Enquiry</a> screen.</p>

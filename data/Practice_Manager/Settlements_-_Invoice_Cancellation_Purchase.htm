<h1>Settlements - Invoice Cancellation</h1>
<p>Invoices that have been posted cannot be deleted. As such, if there 
 is an error in the invoice, it will have to be cancelled. To cancel, you 
 can use the Credit Note Wizard which can perform full or partial cancellation 
 of the invoice.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<h3>Credit/Debit Note Wizard</h3>
<p>This function is accessible through the Cancel D/C Note button in <a 
	 href="Settlements_-_Invoice_Folder_Purchase.htm">Settlements - Invoice</a> 
 screen. It allows for outstanding invoices to be cancelled.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p class="FldExplain">Invoice Lines</p>
<p>This shows the invoice lines for the selected invoice.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p class="FldExplain">Cancellation options</p>
<ul class="hcp1">
	<li><p><span class="hcp2">Select All</span> - Tick to 
	 select all invoice lines and options.</p></li>
	<li><p><span class="hcp2">Create Credit (Debit) Note</span> 
	 - Tick to automatically create the credit/debit note. This is ticked 
	 by default and will remain ticked.</p></li>
	<li><p><span class="hcp2">Prompt Posting screen to post 
	 the Credit (Debit) Note</span> - Tick to view the posting screen. 
	 This allows for you to change the invoice date and/or journal date 
	 if necessary. You can also choose to send credit/debit note to Document 
	 Queue to be printed.</p></li>
	<li><p><span class="hcp2">Settle both the original and 
	 newly created Credit (Debit) Note</span> - Tick to automatically settle 
	 both the invoice and the credit/debit note.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p class="FldExplain">Create</p>
<p>Click this to cancel the invoice and create the Credit (Debit) Note.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p class="FldExplain">Cancel</p>
<p>Click this to exit the screen.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<h4>Using Credit/Debit Note Wizard</h4>
<ol class="hcp3">
	<li><p>Select the invoice.</p></li>
	<li><p>Click Cancel D/C Note. </p></li>
	<li><p>The Credit/Debit Note wizard is seen. In this screen, you will 
	 see the invoices lines. This allows you to specify if you want the 
	 invoice to be cancelled in full or not. Tick only the lines that you 
	 want to cancel. If you wish to cancel all lines, click Select All.</p></li>
	<li><p>Select the options for the cancellation.</p></li>
	<li><p>Click Create to start.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<h3>Manual Cancellation</h3>
<p>To perform a manual cancellation, create the offset credit/debit note, 
 similar to how the system creates an offset credit/debit note when you 
 perform an automatic cancellation. Depending on your internal process, 
 the amount of this offset invoice may equal the amount of the invoice 
 or it may be the sum of the portion being cancelled, i.e. the unpaid portion. 
 After that, settle the purchase orders and the resulting debit note.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<h4>Make a Receipt/Payment</h4>
<ol class="hcp3">
	<li><p>Select the invoice that is being cancelled.</p></li>
	<li><p>Click Receipt/Payment. This will launch the Receipt/Payment 
	 screen.</p></li>
	<li><p>Tick the Settle multiple documents and, if necessary, the Settle 
	 by Invoice Line checkboxes. This will list all outstanding invoices 
	 for the Billing/Supplier File.</p></li>
	<li><p>Select the invoice that is being cancelled, the offset credit/debit 
	 note that you created, and where relevant, the newly-created replacement 
	 invoice.</p></li>
	<li><p>The total Amount Rec'd (DR)/Amount Paid (CR) should be 0. If 
	 you are settling a sales invoice, you may need to manually change 
	 this to 0.</p></li>
	<li><p>You may want to enter relevant text as to why the invoices are 
	 being cancelled.</p></li>
	<li><p>Click Update.</p></li>
	<li><p>The original invoice has now been settled against the credit/debit 
	 note. Where relevant the sum paid to the invoice is now settled to 
	 the replacement invoice.</p></li>
</ol>

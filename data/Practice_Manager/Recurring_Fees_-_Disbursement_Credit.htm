<h1>Recurring Fees - Disbursement Credit</h1>
<p>Disbursement Credit Service refers to a type of recurring fee that allows 
 for a specified amount of chargeable disbursement to not be invoiced for 
 a Billing File or Matter. This is done using the service class 'Credit: 
 Disbursement Charge [CD] with the credit specified through the setup of 
 the service in the Recurring Fees screen as a recurring fee where:</p>
<ul class="hcp1">
	<li><p>The 'Fee Period - From' and 'Fee Period - To' determine the 
	 from and to date of the <span style="font-weight: bold;">applicable 
	 credit period</span>.</p></li>
	<li><p>The credit is entered as a negative amount in Unit Price and 
	 it is to be charged in Advanced.<br>
	<br>
	<img src="../image130.gif" alt="" style="border: none;" width="518" height="82" border="0"></p></li>
</ul>
<p>The credit will then be applied against chargeable disbursement entries 
 with dates that fall in the applicable period. On Posting of WIP (where 
 such fee exists and is due for invoicing), the program will calculate 
 the chargeable amount for all disbursement entries due in the applicable 
 period.</p>

<table style="border-collapse: separate; border-collapse: separate;" cellspacing="0" 
		 border="1">
	<col style="width: 100%;">
	<tr>
		<td><p>When the total chargeable amount is more or equal to the 
		 credit amount, the program will:</p>
		<ul class="hcp1">
			<li><p>Add the Disbursement Credit Service recurring fee to 
			 the draft invoice for the full (credit) fee amount.</p></li>
			<li><p>Invoice all the disbursement charges.</p></li>
		</ul>
		<p>The resulting invoice will have one credit line (the Disbursement 
		 Credit Service recurring fee) and a line for each distinct service 
		 code used for the disbursement entries.</p>
		<p>&#160;</p></td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td><p>When the total chargeable amount is less than the credit 
		 amount and the applicable period's 'to date' is earlier than the 
		 date set for Posting Control Settings - WIP Time's Date Open, 
		 the program will:</p>
		<ul class="hcp1">
			<li><p>Add the Disbursement Credit Service recurring fee to 
			 the draft invoice for a (credit) fee amount equal to all disbursement 
			 charges.</p></li>
			<li><p>Invoice all the disbursement charges.</p></li>
		</ul>
		<p>This is to say that the Disbursement Credit Service recurring 
		 fee is invoiced as the end date falls before the WIP Time's Date 
		 Open. Hence no more disbursement entries can be entered in the 
		 applicable period.</p>
		<p>The resulting invoice will have one credit line (the Disbursement 
		 Credit Service recurring fee) and a line for each distinct service 
		 code used with the disbursement entries. The total invoice amount 
		 will be 0 unless there are other recurring fee or disbursements 
		 due for invoicing.</p>
		<p>&#160;</p></td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td><p>Otherwise, the Disbursement Credit Service and time are 
		 not invoiced as the (credit) fee amount has not been reached and 
		 disbursement charges can still be added for the applicable period.</p>
		<p>Note that any disbursement charges with a date before the applicable 
		 period will be invoiced as usual (the Disbursement Credit Service 
		 is not applied).</p>

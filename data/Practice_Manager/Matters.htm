<h1>Matters</h1>
<p>A Matter can be regarded as a project or job defined for a particular 
 Billing File. It can be used as a definition for the type of work done 
 for a client, for example company secretarial work, or it could be a specific 
 project, for example finalisation of accounts for a certain period or 
 to hold funds on behalf of the client.</p>
<p>Separate invoices are issued for different Matters, these can be settled 
 directly with a receipt or payment from the client or can be offset against 
 advance payments already entered for the Matter. Payments to third parties 
 can also be recorded and a running balance of the Matter will be maintained. 
 Matters can be revalued to handle exchange rate differences.</p>
<p>The usage of Matters is enabled by ticking 'Use Matters' option in <a 
	 href="../Configuration/System_Defaults_-_Practice_Management.htm">System 
 Defaults &gt; Practice Management</a>. If you opt not to use Matters, 
 you must still create a general Matter for your Billing Files.</p>
<p>You can set up the Billing File's Matter(s) in the Matters screen.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<h2>Matters Screen</h2>
<p>This screen is used to manage the Matters for Billing File in the File 
 Maintenance.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p class="FldExplain">Filters</p>
<p>You can choose to filter Matters by:</p>
<ul class="hcp1">
	<li><p>Matter Status</p></li>
	<li><p>Matter Type</p></li>
</ul>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p class="FldExplain">Matter List</p>
<p>This lists all the Matters that you have set up for the Billing File.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p class="FldExplain">Command buttons</p>
<p>These apply to the Matter list. Click the relevant command button to 
 perform the necessary.</p>
<ul class="hcp1">
	<li><p><span class="hcp2">New</span> - Click this to 
	 <a class="dropspot" href="javascript:TextPopup(this)" id="a4">add</a> 
	 a Matter manually. You can also add a Matter using the Copy Fees command 
	 button.</p>
	<div class="droptext" id="POPUP419335190" style="display: none;">
		<ol style="list-style: decimal;">
			<li><p>Enter details for the new Matter.</p>
			<ul class="hcp1">
				<li><p><span class="hcp2">Matter Type</span> 
				 - Select the Matter type. The selections available are 
				 set up in the Matter Type Codes [MTTR] lookup table.</p></li>
				<li><p><span class="hcp2">Extension</span> 
				 - Enter an extension of up to ten characters if you are 
				 using the same Matter type more than once. For example, 
				 you might want to use a general Matter for different departments 
				 and add the department abbreviation to the Matter type, 
				 for instance General CS for General Matter for the Company 
				 Secretarial department.</p></li>
				<li><p><span class="hcp2">Matter User Combo</span> 
				 - This is a user-definable field that can be used as necessary. 
				 Customise the caption and add items for selection in the 
				 Matter User Defined Combo [MTUC] lookup table.</p></li>
				<li><p><span class="hcp2">Description</span> 
				 - The description field defaults to the Matter type and 
				 extension. Change this if necessary and enter a suitable 
				 description for the Matter you are creating. This is the 
				 description that is seen by users entering time against 
				 the Matter, so it should be as concise and accurate as 
				 possible.</p></li>
				<li><p><span class="hcp2">Billing Currency</span> 
				 - Select the invoice currency for the Matter. This is 
				 the default currency for invoices raised against this 
				 Matter. If your environment is enabled for multi-currency 
				 rates, then all time and disbursement entries against 
				 the Matter will follow this currency.</p></li>
				<li><p><span class="hcp2">Revenue Entity</span> 
				 - Select a Revenue Entity for the Matter. Revenue Entities 
				 must be set up in advance.<br>

				<div class="droptext" id="POPUP373478869" style="display: none;">

    </div></li>
				<li><p><span class="hcp2">Tax Charge Type</span> 
				 - Select the tax applicable to services charged to that 
				 Matter. This will be applied during Billing Run and ad 
				 hoc invoicing. Options are to be set up in the Tax (VAT/GST 
				 etc) Charge Types [TCHT] lookup table.</p></li>
				<li><p><span class="hcp2">Invoice Dispatch</span> 
				 - This field can be used to record how the Billing File 
				 prefers to receive the invoice. The options are to be 
				 set up in the Matter Invoice Despatch [MTCL] lookup table. 
				 Note that the field is turned off by default.</p></li>
				<li><p><span class="hcp2">Remit from</span> 
				 - This field is for recording purposes only and options 
				 are bank accounts that have been set up and approved in 
				 the Billing File's <a href="Payer_Bank_Accounts.htm">Payer

				<li><p><span class="hcp2">Organisational 
				 Unit</span> - Select the organisational unit for the Matter. 
				 The options available for selection are maintained in 
				 the Organisational Units [ORGUNITS] user table. If you 
				 are using WIP Accrual Accounting, then it should be noted 
				 that you may link more than one Matter to the same Revenue 
				 Entity, but each Matter may have a different organisational 
				 unit. Find out more about this in the Accounting help 
				 file under the topic Posting Rules - WIP Accrual Posting.</p></li>
				<li><p><span class="hcp2">Rate List</span>

				 currency&gt;</span> - Enter the minimum amount works in 
				 progress must reach before they can be posted to an invoice. 
				 You can see how this amount affects the invoicing process 
				 when you propose drafts of works in progress.</p></li>

				 - Enter the maximum amount that can be charged to the 
				 Matter based on the Client Fee Agreement. This amount 
				 is reflected in the Time Entries screen within Time and 
				 Disbursements component. When creating time entries, the 
				 system will warn the user if the total value has exceeded 
				 the available amount by highlighting the available value 
				 in red. Note that this is not a cumulative limit: once 
				 works in progress have been posted to an invoice, the 
				 available limit is reset to the maximum amount.</p></li>

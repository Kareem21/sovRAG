<h1>Fees Payable - Batch Maintenance</h1>
<p>Payment batches can be created to group disbursements payable to third 
 parties, in instances when your organisation only wishes to pay them on 
 settlement of client invoices. An example of such a fee is the annual 
 government fee payable for continuation of incorporation, which is a recurring 
 fee chargeable to the Billing File (client), where you only pay the government 
 after settlement of the invoice by the client.</p>
<p>Viewpoint recommends that entities selected for strike off are added 
 to a payment batch designated for strike off.</p>
<p>When you select this function in the Fees Payable screen, the Payment 
 Batch Maintenance screen opens in a separate window.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p class="FldExplain">Service</p>
<p>Select the service you want to filter by. By default, only the active 
 batches are displayed. If you want to show the inactive batches then change 
 the active/inactive filter accordingly. This will update the records displayed 
 in the table.</p>

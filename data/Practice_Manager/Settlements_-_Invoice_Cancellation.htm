<h1>Settlements - Invoice Cancellation</h1>
<p>Invoices that have been posted cannot be deleted. As such, if there 
 is an error in the invoice, it will have to be cancelled. To cancel, you 
 can use the Credit Note Wizard which can perform full or partial cancellation 
 of the invoice.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<h3>Credit/Debit Note Wizard</h3>
<p>This function is accessible through the Cancel D/C Note button in <a 
	 href="Receivables.htm">Receivables</a> and <a href="Settlements_-_Invoice_Folder_Sales.htm">Settlements 
 - Invoice</a> screen. It allows for outstanding invoices to be cancelled.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p class="FldExplain">Invoice Lines</p>
<p>This shows the invoice lines for the selected invoice and available 
 action for the cancellation such as resetting the recurring fee. The actions 
 depend on the invoice line.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p class="FldExplain">Pending Actions list</p>
<p>This shows pending actions for the selected invoice.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p class="FldExplain">Command buttons</p>
<p>Click on the relevant command button to perform the necessary. The buttons 
 apply to the Pending Actions list.</p>

				 Number'.</p></li>

<p>&#160;</p>
<h4>Using Credit/Debit Note Wizard</h4>
<ol class="hcp3">
	<li><p>Select the invoice.</p></li>
	<li><p>Click Cancel D/C Note. The Cancel D/C Note button is enabled 
	 for both DR Note and CR Note (document type CR_N only) in Sales ledger, 
	 however, it is only enabled for document type C_PO in Purchase ledger. 
	 The button is also enabled when the invoice has discount of 100% and 
	 is not settled.</p></li>
	<li><p>The Credit/Debit Note wizard is seen. In this screen, you will 
	 see the invoices lines. This allows you to specify if you want the 
	 invoice to be cancelled in full or not. Tick only the lines that you 
	 want to cancel. If you wish to cancel all lines, click Select All.</p></li>
	<li><p>Tick the applicable actions. The actions depend on the invoice 
	 lines and they are:</p>
	<ul class="hcp1">
		<li><p>Reset Recurring Fee - This action is available if the invoice 
		 line is derived from Recurring Fees and if ticked, will reset 
		 the recurring fee's next due date. If the service has been deactivated 
		 by the creation of the invoice, this will re-activate it. This 
		 action is not available if the invoice line has been partially 
		 settled.</p></li>
		<li><p>Reverse Time Entries - This action is available if the invoice 
		 line is derived from time entries and if ticked, will reverse 
		 the relevant time entries. If the invoice line has been partially 
		 settled, this action is not available.</p></li>
		<li><p>Reverse Disbursement Entries - This action is available 
		 if the invoice line is derived from disbursement entries and if 
		 ticked, will reverse the relevant disbursement entries. If the 
		 invoice line has been partially settled, this action is not available.</p></li>
	</ul></li>
	<li><p>Select the options for the cancellation.</p></li>
	<li><p>Click Create to start.</p></li>
</ol>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">Note</span>: If 
 there is no settlement for the invoice, by default, all invoice lines 
 will be ticked in the Credit Note wizard screen. However, if there has 
 been settlement made to any of the invoice lines, then the line will not 
 be ticked by default.</p>
<p>If the option 'Use Recurring Services for Time Postings' or 'Use Recurring 
 Services for Disbursement Postings' is enabled, reversing time or disbursement 
 entries will also reset the 'Next Invoicing Due' date for the services 
 in Recurring Fees screen.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<h3>Manual Cancellation</h3>
<p>There are two methods of cancelling an invoice manually:</p>
<ul class="hcp1">
	<li><p>Settle to Matter, in which both the invoice and the offset credit 
	 note are settled to Matter; and</p></li>
	<li><p>Make a receipt/payment to both the invoice and the offset credit/debit 
	 note.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Before you can proceed with a manual cancellation:</p>
<ul class="hcp1">
	<li><p>Create the offset credit/debit note, similar to how the system 
	 creates an offset credit/debit note when you perform an automatic 
	 cancellation. Depending on your internal process, the amount of this 
	 offset invoice may be equal to the amount of the invoice or it may 
	 be the sum of the portion being cancelled, i.e. the unpaid portion.</p></li>
	<li><p>If the offset invoice cancels the total of the original invoice, 
	 you may also create a new invoice/supplier invoice to replace the 
	 one that is being cancelled.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Once you have done this, follow the steps below to complete the cancellation.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<h4>Settle to Matter</h4>
<p>Settling to Matter can only be done for Sales invoices. You need to 
 perform the following:</p>
<ol class="hcp3">
	<li><p>Select the invoice that is being cancelled.</p></li>
	<li><p>Click Settle to Matter. This will launch the Settle to Matter 
	 Account screen.</p></li>
	<li><p>Tick the Settle Multiple Documents and, if necessary, the Settle 
	 by Invoice Line checkboxes. This will list all outstanding invoices 
	 for the selected Matter.</p></li>
	<li><p>Select the invoice that is being cancelled and the offset credit 
	 note that you created. If you are cancelling the whole invoice and 
	 want to apply the amount received from the client to the replacement 
	 invoice, then also select the replacement invoice at this point.</p></li>
	<li><p>The total Amount Rec'd (DR) should be 0.</p></li>
	<li><p>You may want to enter relevant text as to why the invoices are 
	 being cancelled.</p></li>
	<li><p>Click Update.</p></li>
	<li><p>The original invoice has now been settled against the credit 
	 note. Where relevant the sum paid to the invoice is now settled to 
	 the replacement invoice.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>If there is no replacement invoice, the amount received from the client 
 will be held in the Matter account. Refer to &#160;<a href="settle_to_matter.htm">Settlements 
 - Settle to Matter</a>.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<h4>Make a Receipt/Payment</h4>
<p>This method works in a similar manner to a settle to Matter.</p>
<ol class="hcp3">
	<li><p>Select the invoice that is being cancelled.</p></li>
	<li><p>Click Receipt/Payment. This will launch the Receipt/Payment 
	 screen.</p></li>
	<li><p>Tick the Settle Multiple Documents and, if necessary, the Settle 
	 by Invoice Line checkboxes. This will list all outstanding invoices 
	 for the Billing/Supplier File.</p></li>
	<li><p>Select the invoice that is being cancelled, the offset credit/debit 
	 note that you created, and where relevant, the newly-created replacement 
	 invoice.</p></li>
	<li><p>The total Amount Rec'd (DR)/Amount Paid (CR) should be 0. If 
	 you are settling a sales invoice, you may need to manually change 
	 this to 0.</p></li>
	<li><p>You may want to enter relevant text as to why the invoices are 
	 being cancelled.</p></li>
	<li><p>Click Update.</p></li>
	<li><p>The original invoice has now been settled against the credit/debit 
	 note. Where relevant the sum paid to the invoice is now settled to 
	 the replacement invoice.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p><a class="dropspot" href="javascript:TextPopup(this)" id="a1">Will the time 
 and disbursement entries that were linked to this invoice be reversed?</a></p>
 <div class="droptext" id="POPUP373868107" style="display: none;">
	<p>If you have selected the Reverse time/disb on cancel invoice option 
	 in Configuration &gt; Settings &gt; System Defaults &gt; Practice 
	 Management then the posted entries will be reversed, provided you 
	 select Start in Step 5 above.</p>
	<p>In this case, identical entries will be created with negative amounts 
	 to cancel out the original time and disbursement charges, and then 
	 the entries are recreated in Time and Disbursements so that they can 
	 be pulled into a new invoice. The dates in the Posting Control Settings 
	 will have no bearing on the creation of the replacement entries.</p>

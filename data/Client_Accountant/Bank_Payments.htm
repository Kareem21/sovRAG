<h1>Bank Payments</h1>
<div>
<p style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic; color: #334796;">This 
 feature is an additional option and is only available if included in your 
 licence.</p>
</div>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>The Bank Payments feature in the Accounting component enables you to 
 create and approve payees/bank payments; as well as subsequently prepare 
 a bank payment export file to be sent to your bank(s) for further processing. 
 It comprises:</p>
<ul class="hcp1">
	<li><p><a href="../Configuration/Approval_Cards.htm">Approval Cards</a> 
	 - Define approval cards containing the rules on the user(s) and/or 
	 group(s) of users authorised to approve payees and payments; and the 
	 amount they are authorised to approve.</p></li>
	<li><p>Bank Export Batch configuration - Bank Master Files can be configured 
	 to create export batch files, which will be sent to banks for further 
	 processing. This is through the <a href="Payment_Types_&amp;_Export_Batches.htm">Payment 
	 Types &amp; Export Batches</a> screen.</p></li>
	<li><p>Payee setup and Approval - Set up payees with bank payment details 
	 and a maximum authorised payment amount. Payees will be approved based 
	 on the rules in the approval cards. This can be done through:</p></li>
	<li style="list-style: none; display: inline;"><ul class="hcp1">
		<li><p><a href="Payees.htm">Payees</a> and <a href="Payees_and_Approval.htm">Payments 
		 &amp; Approvals</a> screens for Accounting</p></li>
		<li><p><a href="../Administrator/Distributions.htm">Distributions</a> 
		 and <a href="../Administrator/Assets.htm">Assets</a> screens for 
		 Entity Administration</p></li>
		<li><p><a href="../Practice_Manager/Payee_Bank_Accounts.htm">Payee 
		 Bank Accounts</a>, <a href="../Practice_Manager/Payer_Bank_Accounts.htm">Payer 
		 Bank Accounts</a> and <a href="../Practice_Manager/Payee_Payer_Bank_Accounts.htm">Payee/Payer 
		 Bank Accounts</a> screens for Practice Management</p></li>
	</ul></li>
	<li><p>Payment creation and Approval - Create payments for pre-approved 
	 payees in Client Accountant, Entity Administration and Practice Management. 
	 Payments will be approved based on the rules in the approval cards.</p></li>
	<li><p>Payment Release and Batch (Re)Assign - Approved payments are 
	 released to a manual or an exportable bank payment batch. Once released, 
	 the payment will automatically create a pending journal using the 
	 sub-ledger details and optionally, the journal script selected during 
	 payment creation. These payments can be reassigned to a different 
	 payment batch as needed. This can be done in the <a href="Payments_Released.htm">Payments 
	 Released</a> screen.</p></li>
	<li><p>Export and/or Close Payment Batches - Once the payment batches 
	 are complete, prepare the export batch files (where applicable) for 
	 subsequent transmission to the bank and close the payment batches. 
	 This is through the <a href="Payment_Types_&amp;_Export_Batches.htm">Payment 
	 Types &amp; Export Batches</a> screen.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>To use this feature, ensure the following:</p>
<ul class="hcp1">
	<li><p>Set up the approval cards in Approval Cards screen&#160;- after 
	 this has been set up, then you can create payees with bank payment 
	 details and a maximum authorised payment amount. Payees will be approved 
	 base on the rules in payee approval cards.</p></li>
	<li><p>Verify/configure journal scripts - it is recommended that Bank 
	 Account sub-ledge journal script(s) for Bank Payments have been verified 
	 and properly configured as these journal scripts are used when creating 
	 new pending journals upon the release of an approved payment to a 
	 bank payment batch.</p></li>
	<li><p>Obtain export file configuration from your bank - if you wish 
	 to send export batch files to your bank for further processing, you 
	 need to have the file requirements from the bank before you start 
	 the configuration of the export file. Currently, the exportable file 
	 formats are csv and xml.</p></li>
</ul>

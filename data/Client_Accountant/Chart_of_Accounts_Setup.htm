<h1>Chart of Accounts Setup</h1>
<p>There are three layers to the structure of Accounting:</p>
<ul>
	<li class="p"><p>Global account classification.</p></li>
	<li class="p"><p>Shared templates.</p></li>
	<li class="p"><p>Entity accounting.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The global account classification used in Accounting is split into three 
 groups: Main and Sub groups, nominal accounts and sub-ledger accounts. 
 Main and Sub groups are defined globally for the database and can be regarded 
 as a general account classification that pre-defines the reports, balance 
 sheet, profit and loss enquiries. Examples of Main groups are Assets, 
 Liabilities, Expenses and Income.</p>
<p>Each Main group has its own Sub groups, which are linked directly to 
 their corresponding nominal accounts. The global account classification 
 forms the backbone of the program; therefore, it is important to give 
 due weight and consideration when structuring it.</p>
<p>Nominal accounts are either for direct posting, or function as control 
 accounts for sub-ledger accounts. Control accounts have sub-ledger accounts 
 linked to them, where the posting will take place.</p>
<p>For example, a control account can be specified for bank accounts. You 
 would then set up a sub-ledger account for each bank account. Similarly, 
 a control account can be specified for securities, and you would set up 
 separate sub-ledger accounts for each security held. Transactions are 
 recorded in the sub-ledger accounts and posted. Once posted, the control 
 account balances will be updated with the transaction information.</p>
<p>Each grouping of Main, Sub and nominal accounts is known as a Chart 
 of Accounts (CoA) template. You can have as many CoA templates as required, 
 depending on the Account Files that you create in Viewpoint. For example, 
 you may use specific templates for property-holding companies, trade companies 
 and trusts - each template can be used in as many Account Files as required.</p>
<p>A CoA template can be further customised in each individual Account 
 File. Thus, you may use a specific template for a particular entity type, 
 but you may further activate or deactivate nominal accounts in the Account 
 File once the template has been assigned to the Account File.</p>
<p>Journals are used to record transactions into the nominal (general) 
 ledger. There is an optional provisional journal (draft journal) facility 
 for management review and control before permanent posting to the nominal 
 ledger takes place. Account b<span style="margin-bottom: 0;">alances are 
 updated after each posting of either a provisional/ draft journal or a 
 regular journal.</span></p>
<p>The setting up of a Chart of Accounts requires the following to be set 
 up:</p>

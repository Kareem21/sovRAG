<h1>Journal Posting Reconciliation</h1>
<p>You can use the journal posting reconciliation reports provided in the 
 Practice Management component to check for discrepancies that may exist 
 between the journals in Practice Management and the ones in Accounting. 
 If the journals in both modules are balanced, the difference between the 
 two totals will be nil.</p>
<p>In cases where there is a difference in the two totals, run the posting 
 function to post any outstanding journals from Practice Management to 
 Accounting. Any errors identified in the posting process should be resolved 
 before the posting process is run again.</p>

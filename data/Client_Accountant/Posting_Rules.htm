<h1>Posting Rules</h1>
<p>This feature is used when you want to post journals based on a set of 
 rules. There are four different types of rules that can be created:</p>
<ul class="hcp1">
	<li class="p"><p><a class="dropspot" href="javascript:TextPopup(this)" id="a1">Appropriate 
	 Deferred Income</a></p>
	<div class="droptext" id="POPUP413143727" style="display: none;">
		<p>This rule type is used for deferred income/expense, and will 
		 calculate and divide a fixed amount from a designated &quot;source&quot; 
		 account for periodic release into a &quot;release&quot; account.</p>
		<p>Deferred income is income that is received for goods or services 
		 that have yet to be supplied or rendered. An example of this would 
		 be when you bill a client in advance for the services to be provided 
		 for the coming year, such as for management fees. The full amount 
		 cannot yet be recognised as income and is thus placed in a liability 
		 account, to be progressively moved to an income account as the 
		 year progresses.</p>
		<p>An item that gives rise to deferred income is prepayment, or 
		 deferred expense. If you are keeping client accounts, then the 
		 payment made by the client to you for services-to-be-rendered, 
		 is considered prepayment. In the client's accounts, the amount 
		 is placed in an asset account and progressively moved to an expense 
		 account as the year progresses. If you also pay a supplier in 
		 advance for goods or services to be supplied or rendered, then 
		 this would also be recorded as a deferred expense.</p>
		<p>In the explanation given above, the amounts posted to the source 
		 account originate from the Billing module. In this case, the following 
		 must be done in order to use this rule type:</p>
		<ul class="hcp1">
			<li><p>Account mapping - Account mapping must be done for the 
			 services that feed the source account.</p></li>
			<li><p>Posting rule - This must be set up correctly to ensure 
			 that each source account feeds the correct release account.</p></li>
			<li><p>Exchange rates - All relevant exchange rates must be 
			 set up.</p></li>
			<li><p>Beginning and end dates - The beginning and end dates 
			 for the post to the source account determine how long the 
			 rule will run. These dates are represented by the Date - From 
			 and Date - To fields of the detail line of the invoice. The 
			 same fields must be completed for supplier invoices.&#160;The 
			 Date - From will be updated as Line Date whereas the Date 
			 - To will be updated as Reconcile Date in the invoice's journal. 
			 </p></li>
		</ul>
		<p>You may also create a journal to feed the source account directly 
		 in Accounting. In this case, you need to enter the beginning and 
		 end dates of the period into the fields that are represented by 
		 the Line Date and Reconciliation Date fields in the Journal screen.</p>
		<p>When the rule is run, the system calculates the number of days 
		 in the specified run period and divides that by the number of 
		 days specified by the beginning and end dates in the invoice or 
		 journal. This number is then multiplied by the amount of the invoice 
		 or journal. This final amount is moved from the source to the 
		 release account.</p>
		<p>For example:</p>
		<p>You have an invoice for Director fees for the period from 1 
		 January to 31 December amounting to EUR12,000.00.</p>
		<p>If you run this rule from 1 January to 31 March, the amount 
		 moved from the source account to the release account would be 
		 calculated as follows:</p>

		<p>This feature posts bad debt provisions from invoices created 
		 in Billing, and reverses them the next day. It is a useful management 
		 reporting tool, and is meant for use by Revenue Entities only. 
		 When run, the system checks through all outstanding invoices for 
		 bad debt provisions and compares them to the invoice amount based 
		 on the date of the run.</p>
		<ul class="hcp1">
			<li><p>If the provision amount is lower than the invoice amount,

		</ul>
		<p>If you utilise the organisational units feature, then the provisions 
		 are grouped by organisational unit.</p>
		<p>The following must be done In order to use this rule type:</p>
		<ul class="hcp1">
			<li><p>Account mapping - This is done in System Manager, and 
			 must be done correctly for the components specified below; 
			 which is found under Control Accounts - Sales Ledger for the

			 [PMAT] lookup table.</p></li>

				<li><p>Debtors Provision (Credit) [R.SO] - This is the 
				 nominal account where provisions are credited to.</p></li>
				<li><p>Debtors Provision (Debit) [R.SP] - This is the nominal 
				 account where provisions are debited to.</p></li>
			</ul></li>
			<li><p>Posting rule - This must be set up correctly so that 
			 the appropriate journal reference and line description is 
			 used for the journal entries.</p></li>
		</ul>
		<p>Debtor provision calculation can be set in the tag value of

			<li><p>XX is a sequence number in 2 digit format, 01, 02, 03 
			 to 10 with maximum ten brackets.</p></li>
			<li><p>Y is the period from the invoice due date. Y denotes 
			 Year, M denotes Month, W denotes Week and D denotes Day.</p></li>
			<li><p>P is percentage of provision, valid range from 1 to 
			 100.</p></li>
			<li><p>X can be <span class="hcp5">A</span> for 
			 Ageing or <span class="hcp5">I</span> for Invoicing.</p></li>

		<p>[Provision02_M=18][Provision02_Percent=80]</p>
		<p class="hcp7">&#160;</p>
		<p class="hcp7">This would mean that provision amount 
		 for Invoice due for two years and above will be 100% of the outstanding 
		 amount. Meanwhile, Provision amount for Invoice due for 18 months 
		 and above will be 80% of the outstanding amount.</p>

		<p class="MsoNormal"><span class="hcp6">An Invoice amounting EUR1000

		 on <strong>1 August 2016</strong> with the amount of EUR100.</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal"><span class="hcp6">When the user runs the 
		 Debtor provision rule on <strong>31 July 2016</strong> with Tag 
		 Values defined above, it identifies that it has exceeded 120 days 
		 but yet to reach 12 months. This provision rule will apply:</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 48px;"><span class="hcp6">[Provision01_d=120][Provision04_Percent=40]</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal"><span class="hcp6">The provision amount will 
		 be 40% of the unsettled debt.</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal"><span class="hcp6">Hence on 31 July 2016, 
		 Provision amount = EUR1000 X 40% = EUR400.</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal"><span class="hcp6">However, when the user 
		 runs the Debtor provision rule on <strong>1 August 2016 (or onwards)</strong>, 
		 the debtor has settled an amount of EUR100, resulting in the total 
		 of unsettled debt to EUR1000-EUR100 = EUR900. Hence the Provision 
		 amount = EUR900 X 40% = EUR360.</span></p>
		<p>The provision amount will be posted to the journal.</p>
		<p>When the rule is run, the sum of all bad debts up to the Reconcile 
		 date is credited to the Debtors Provision (Credit) [R.SO] account. 
		 This credit is matched by a debit to the Debtors Provision (Debit) 
		 [R.SP] account. Both transactions use the Reconcile date as the 
		 journal date. The entries are then immediately reversed, using 
		 the next day's date as the journal date.</p>
		<p>&#160;</p>
		<p>By default, Debtors Provision Accrual calculates the amount 
		 based on the invoice 'Due Date'.</p>
		<p>It also supports calculation based on 'Invoice Date' by adding 
		 a tag line [Provision_DateType=DateInvoice].</p>
		<p class="hcp6">Example 3</p>
		<p>[Provision01_Y=2][Provision01_Percent=100]</p>
		<p>[Provision02_M=18][Provision02_Percent=80]</p>
		<p>[Provision03_M=12][Provision03_Percent=60]</p>
		<p>[Provision04_D=120][Provision04_Percent=50]</p>
		<p>[Provision05_D=45][Provision05_Percent=30]</p>
		<p>[Provision_DateType=DateInvoice]</p>
		<p>&#160;</p>
		<p>For example, five invoices are created with details as followed 
		 and the Posting Rule run on date = 31/12/2017.</p>

		<p>By applying the tag [Provision_DateType=DateInvoice], the amount

		<p>This feature posts accrual income from works-in-progress (WIP) 
		 in the Time and Disbursements module, and reverses them the next 
		 day, which may be useful for management reporting purposes. When 
		 run, the system checks through all approved time and disbursement 
		 entries and ignores unapproved ones. As with the Debtors Provision 
		 Accrual rule type, if you are utilising the organisational units 
		 feature, then the WIP amounts for time and disbursements are grouped 
		 by organisational unit. This rule is meant for use on Revenue 
		 Entities only.</p>
		<p>The following must be done in order to use this rule type:</p>
		<ul class="hcp1">
			<li><p>Account mapping - This needs to be done correctly for 
			 the following components under the Control Accounts - Sales 
			 Ledger for the selected Revenue Entity:</p></li>
			<li class="hcp3"><ul class="hcp1">
				<li><p>WIP - Time charges [R.SX] - This is the nominal 
				 account where time charges are debited to.</p></li>
				<li><p>WIP - Time offset [R.ST] - This is the nominal account 
				 where time charges are credited to.</p></li>
				
				<li><p>WIP - Disb. charges [R.SY] - This is the nominal 
				 account where disbursement charges are debited to.</p></li>
				<li><p>WIP - Disb. offset [R.SU] - This is the nominal 
				 account where disbursement charges are credited to.</p></li>
				
			</ul></li>
			<li><p>Posting rule - This must be set up correctly, so that 
			 the appropriate journal reference and line description are 
			 used for the journal entries.</p></li>
		</ul>
		<p>When the rule is run, the sum amount of all approved WIP are 
		 debited and credited to the respective accounts. Immediately after, 
		 this accrual journal is reversed, using the next day's date as 
		 the journal date.</p>
		<p style="font-weight: normal; font-style: normal;">Viewpoint picks 
		 up all approved WIP as at the date entered. As this date can be 
		 in the past, the sum amount will include any works that may have 
		 since been invoiced.</p>

	 <span class="dropspot"><a class="dropspot" href="javascript:TextPopup(this)" id="a8">semi-enabled</a></span>. 
	 For Appropriate Deferred Income [DI] posting rule, the <a class="dropspot" href="javascript:TextPopup(this)" id="a9">Reconcile</a> 
	 option in the 'Run Rule' window allows user to reconcile right after 
	 the run.</p>
	<div class="droptext" id="POPUP577370611" style="display: none;">
		<p>When the Reconcile option is ticked, the system will run rule 
		 from 01/01/1900 in addition to the 'From' date. Hence, you will 
		 see two rules being posted after the successful run.</p>

			 will default to 'the last succeeded run date + 1 day' and 
			 is not editable (date control is disabled). The 'to' date

			 and is editable (date control is enabled). <span class="hcp11">Note</span>: There is a validation on

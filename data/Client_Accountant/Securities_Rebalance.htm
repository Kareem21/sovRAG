<h1>Securities Rebalance</h1>
<p>This feature automatically recalculates the capital and exchange gains/ 
 losses on disposal of securities. This is especially useful when you do 
 not enter securities transactions consecutively. The Securities Rebalance 
 feature proposes the correcting entries as if the securities transactions 
 were entered following the right date sequence.</p>
<p>Once users have verified the calculations, the corrections can be posted 
 with the click of a button.&#160;Journal entries are created automatically 
 to reflect these corrections and update the account balances.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">Note</span>: This 
 feature can only correct draft journals – permanent journals can no longer 
 be corrected.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<h3>Prerequisite</h3>
<p>Account Files must be set up with the following options to enable the 
 Securities Rebalance feature to work:</p>

<h3>Triggering Securities Rebalance via Journal Scripts</h3>
<p>The Securities Rebalance calculations can also be triggered via Journal 
 Scripts. Add 1 of the following Tags to the first line of the Securities 
 Journal Scripts:</p>
<ul class="hcp2">
	<li><p>[Initiate=REBAL] – When you click the Post &#160;button to use 
	 this Journal Script, the Security Rebalance window will prompt if 
	 there are any unposted corrections. This might be included in a Securities 
	 acquisition Journal Script.</p></li>
	<li><p>[After_Post=REBAL] – When you click the Post &#160;button to 
	 post the Journal Script entry, the Security Rebalance window will 
	 prompt if there are any unposted corrections.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>&#160;</p>
<h3>Calculations - No Exchange Gain/ Loss</h3>
<p>The Securities sub-ledger currency is the same as the Account File’s 
 base currency (USD), in this case USD. Hence, there will be no exchange 
 gains/ losses on disposal.</p>
<p>The following corrections have been proposed:</p>
<p><img src="../image158.jpg" alt="" width="606" height="199" border="0" class="hcp1"></p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<h4>Proposed Corrections</h4>
<p>The proposed corrections are based on the following calculations:</p>
<p><img src="../image159.jpg" alt="" width="700" height="204" border="0" class="hcp1"></p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>All transactions in the Securities sub-ledger before the disposal transaction 
 are taken into account in calculating the disposal cost except for the 
 unrealised revaluation transaction.</p>
<p>In addition, subsequent disposals are calculated as if you had posted 
 the proposed corrections on previous disposals. This in calculating the 
 disposal cost of the second disposal, the corrected disposal cost of the 
 first disposal in used; and in calculating the disposal cost of the third 
 disposal, the corrected disposal costs of the first two disposals are 
 used.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<h4>Capital Gain/ Loss</h4>
<p>The corrected capital gain/ loss amount is based on the following calculations:</p>
<p><img src="../image114.gif" alt="" width="601" height="265" border="0" class="hcp1"></p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<h3>Calculations – Exchange Gain/ Loss</h3>
<p>The Securities sub-ledger currency is different (EUR) from the Account 
 File’s base currency (USD).</p>
<p>The following corrections have been proposed:</p>
<p><img src="../image160.jpg" alt="" width="614" height="204" border="0" class="hcp1"></p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<h4>Proposed Corrections</h4>
<p>The proposed corrections are based on the following calculations:</p>
<p><img src="../image161.jpg" alt="" width="697" height="179" border="0" class="hcp1"></p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>All transactions in the Securities sub-ledger before the disposal transaction 
 are taken into account in calculating the disposal cost except for the 
 unrealised revaluation transaction.</p>
<p>In addition, subsequent disposals are calculated as if you had posted 
 the proposed corrections on previous disposals. This in calculating the 
 disposal cost of the second disposal, the corrected disposal cost of the 
 first disposal in used; and in calculating the disposal cost of the third 
 disposal, the corrected disposal costs of the first two disposals are 
 used.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>

<p><img src="../image162.jpg" alt="" width="609" height="263" border="0" class="hcp1"></p>
<p>&#160;</p>

<h1>Security Models</h1>
<p>Viewpoint uses highly customisable role-based security settings which 
 are defined by a combination of User Roles, User Group Roles, Administrator 
 Groups and, where applicable, Access Groups. It is recommended that you 
 understand how the different models work and select the most suitable 
 one before you proceed to customise and use Viewpoint.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<h2>Security Elements</h2>
<p>The following are the parts that make up Viewpoint's security setup.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p class="FldExplain">User Roles</p>
<p>User Roles define the roles and authorities of a user. A User Role is 
 similar to a job responsibility while the authority determines how high 
 a level of responsibility a user has. You can create as many or as few 
 User Roles as you need, and each role is then assigned to one or more 
 User Groups.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p class="FldExplain">User Groups</p>
<p>Users Groups are groups of users who are defined by the jobs they do 
 and the responsibilities that they have. You need to assign at least one 
 User Role to a User Group, or the users would have no access to Viewpoint. 
 Depending on how you have set up your User Roles, you can assign just 
 one role to a group, or you can assign multiple roles. If the roles that 
 you assign to the group have overlapping authorities, then the highest 
 of the authorities will be taken as the group's authority level. A user 
 can only be assigned to one User Group, so you need to set up as many 
 User Groups as required to cater for this.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p class="FldExplain">Administrator Groups</p>
<p>Administrator Groups can be used to represent departments or, in cases 
 where an organisation has offices in various jurisdictions, it can also 
 represent jurisdictions. Master Files can be assigned to only one Administrator 
 Group, but a user can be assigned to more than one group if he needs to 
 be able to access the files of more than one group. However, the functions 
 he can perform on the Master Files are determined by his User Group.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p class="FldExplain">Access Groups and Access Group Security</p>
<p>Access Groups are used only if you implement the Access + User Group 
 Security Model [3]&#160;as your security model. Access Groups can be combined 
 with any number of Administrator Groups and User Groups so that a user 
 who is assigned an Access Group will be able to access the Master Files 
 in the associated Administrator Group and perform the functions that have 
 been given to the associated User Group. This forms the Access Group Security.</p>
<p>The user's own Administrator Group and User Group are ignored for all 
 Master File-related screens, such as the Statutory screens and the Sales 
 Ledger screens, but are used for access to non-Master File related screens 
 such as the Reporting screens.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<h2>Security Models</h2>
<p>The six models are described below.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<h4>User Group Authority Only [1]</h4>
<p>This is the default security model where you can only control access 
 to the screens and functions in Viewpoint. This means that a user will 
 be able to access all Master Files and perform the same functions for 
 all files. To implement this model, do the following:</p>
<ul class="hcp1">
	<li><p>In Viewpoint Management, Database &gt; Settings &gt; Application, 
	 set Security Model = User Group authority only [1].</p></li>
	<li><p>In Configuration &gt; Users &amp; Security, set up the following:</p></li>
	<li class="hcp2"><ul class="hcp1">
		<li><p>User Roles</p></li>
		<li><p>User Groups</p></li>
		<li><p>Administrator Groups - Although this does not affect Viewpoint 
		 security, you will still need to link this when setting up a user</p></li>
		<li><p>Users - File Access option is to be set to 'Administrator 
		 Groups + View-only for Others [4]'</p></li>
	</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>&#160;</p>
<h4>Administrator + User Group Model [2]</h4>
<p>This model allows for the following control:</p>
<ul class="hcp1">
	<li><p>Access to the screens and functions in Viewpoint.</p></li>
	<li><p>Access to Master Files.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>This means that you can restrict a user from accessing certain Master 
 Files so they will not be able to open the Master Files or view details 
 of the file. However, if the user is allowed to access a Master File, 
 then the screens and functions that they can perform depend on the user's 
 User Group.</p>
<p>The restriction will be based on the Administrator Group and the File 
 Access option set for the user account. To implement this model, do the 
 following:</p>
<ul class="hcp1">
	<li><p>In Viewpoint Management, Database &gt; Settings &gt; Application, 
	 set Security Model = Administrator + User Group model [2].</p></li>
	<li><p>In Configuration &gt; Users &amp; Security, set up the following:</p></li>
	<li class="hcp2"><ul class="hcp1">
		<li><p>User Roles</p></li>
		<li><p>User Groups</p></li>
		<li><p>Administrator Groups</p></li>
		<li><p>Users - ensure that the right File Access option is selected</p></li>
	</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>&#160;</p>
<h4>Access + User Group Model [3]</h4>
<p>This model also allows for the following control:</p>
<ul class="hcp1">
	<li><p>Access to the screens and functions in Viewpoint.</p></li>
	<li><p>Access to Master Files.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>It is similar to the Administrator + User Group Model [2] except that 
 access to the screens and functions for a user can differ based on the 
 Master File. This means that the same user can have different access rights 
 for different Master Files.</p>
<p>For this model, access to screens that are Master File-independent will 
 depend on the user's User Group but access to Master File and screens 
 for the Master File will depend on the Access Group Security which will 
 take into account the Access Group of the user and the Administrator Group 
 of the Master File.</p>
<p>To implement this model, do the following:</p>
<ul class="hcp1">
	<li><p>In Viewpoint Management, Database &gt; Settings &gt; Application, 
	 set Security Model = Access+ User Group model [3].</p></li>
	<li><p>In Configuration &gt; Users &amp; Security, set up the following:</p></li>
	<li class="hcp2"><ul class="hcp1">
		<li><p>User Roles</p></li>
		<li><p>User Groups</p></li>
		<li><p>Administrator Groups</p></li>
		<li><p>Access Groups</p></li>
		<li><p>Access Group Security</p></li>
		<li><p>Users - ensure that the right File Access option is selected</p></li>
	</ul></li>
</ul>
<p><span class="hcp3">Note</span>: For 
 this model, although the user may have authority to the Master File, the 
 Access Group Security will determine whether or not the user will be able 
 to open the Master File.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<h4>User Relation Links [4]</h4>
<p>This model works in the same way as the Administrator + User Group Model 
 [2] except that the system will check on User Relations for the Master 
 File to control access to the Master File. To implement this model, do 
 the following:</p>
<ul class="hcp1">
	<li><p>In Viewpoint Management, Database &gt; Settings &gt; Application, 
	 set Security Model = User Relation Links [4].</p></li>
	<li><p>In Configuration &gt; Users &amp; Security, set up the following:</p></li>
	<li class="hcp2"><ul class="hcp1">
		<li><p>User Roles</p></li>
		<li><p>User Groups</p></li>
		<li><p>Administrator Groups</p></li>
		<li><p>Users - ensure that the right File Access option is selected</p></li>
	</ul></li>
	<li><p>In Configuration &gt; Business Parameters &gt; Entity Administration 
	 &gt; Relationship Types, set up the relevant User Relations.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>For the Master File, ensure that the required User Relations are added.</p>
<h4>&#160;</h4>
<h4>Services Provided Model [5]</h4>
<p>This model allows for two types of control:</p>
<ul class="hcp1">
	<li><p><span class="hcp4">Restriction of Master Files 
	 to users</span> - Users can access a Master File i.e. open the Master 
	 File if the user belongs to the same Administrator Group as the Master 
	 File. </p></li>
	<li><p><span class="hcp4">Different authorities for different 
	 Master Files</span> - Users can have different authority rights for 
	 the different Master Files that the user can access via the Services 
	 Provided screen.</p></li>
	<li><p><span class="hcp4">Restriction to view Administrator 
	 Groups</span> - Users can view other Administrator Groups if the user 
	 belongs to the same Administrator Group. </p></li>
	<li><p><span class="hcp4">Restriction to view other Administrator 
	 Groups Users</span> - Users can view other Administrator Group users 
	 if the user belongs to the&#160;same Administrator Group.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>Regardless of the control type, you can also choose to prevent a user 
 from being able to see a Master File that the user cannot access. This 
 means that if the user does not have access to a Master File, the user 
 will not be able to see the Master File at all e.g. performing a Search 
 Master File using the Master File name will not turn up any result. </p>
<p>To implement this model, do the following:</p>
<ul class="hcp1">
	<li><p>In Viewpoint Management, Database &gt; Settings &gt; Application, 
	 set Security Model = Services Provided Model [5].</p></li>
	<li><p>In Configuration &gt; Settings &gt; Tools &amp; Utilities &gt; 
	 Localise, run the Enable Services Provided Security Model to:</p></li>
	<li class="hcp2"><ul class="hcp1">
		<li><p>Set the Services Provided screen to active.</p></li>
	</ul></li>
	<li><p>In Configuration &gt; Users &amp; Security, set up:</p></li>
	<li class="hcp2"><ul class="hcp1">
		<li><p>User Roles (and Services Provided if you want to have different 
		 authorities for different Master Files)</p></li>
		<li><p>User Groups</p></li>
		<li><p>Administrator Groups</p></li>
		<li><p>Users - ensure that the right <a class="dropspot" href="javascript:TextPopup(this)" id="a1">File 
		 Access option</a> is selected</p>
		<div class="droptext" id="POPUP414439251" style="display: none;">

				</tr>
			</table>
			<p>&#160;</p>
  </div></li>
	</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>For the Master File, the following must be done to ensure access rights 
 are granted:</p>
<ul class="hcp1">
	<li><p>Set the Administrator Group in the Setup screen.</p></li>
	<li><p>Add the relevant services provided to the Master File in the 
	 Services Provided screen for each Administrator Group.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><span class="hcp3">Note</span>: A 
 record will be added automatically to the Services Provided screen when 
 the Administrator Group is assigned in Setup. The record created will 
 have a default service where the default service is retrieved from the 
 'Primary Office Default Service' field in Configuration &gt; Settings 
 &gt; System Default &gt; Security screen. The similar applies when changing 
 the Administrator Group for the Master File. </p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<h4><a name="Service_Office_Model__8_" id="Service_Office_Model__8_"></a>Service 
 Office Model [8]</h4>
<p>This model allows for access to a Master File and the screens within 
 the Master File to be controlled based on the services provided to the 
 Master File from a service office. This means that a user:</p>
<ul class="hcp1">
	<li><p>May not be able to access a Master File if the Master File does 
	 not have any services provided by the service office of the user.</p></li>
	<li><p>Can access a Master File but see only screens based on the services 
	 provided to the Master File by the user's service office.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>However, even if the user does not have access to a Master File, if 
 the user performs a search for the Master File, the user will be able 
 to see the Master File if it exists.</p>
<p>This model takes into account the following concepts:</p>
<ul class="hcp1">
	<li><p>Service Office - This is the Administrator Group and in this 
	 model, a Master File can belong to more than one Administrator Group. 
	 The Administrator Group in the Master File's Setup screen is known 
	 as the primary service office. Other service offices assigned to the 
	 Master File in the Service Office screen are the secondary service 
	 offices.</p></li>
	<li><p>Master File Owner - This refers to users who belong to the same 
	 Administrator Group as the Master File's primary service office. This 
	 can be the user's default Administrator Group or any other Administrator 
	 Group of the user.</p></li>
	<li><p>Services Provided - This refers to User Roles that are tagged 
	 with 'SP' in the Electronic Filing Code field in the User Roles [URLS] 
	 lookup table so that it appears in the Service Office screen for selection.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>To implement this model, you need to do the following:</p>
<ul class="hcp1">
	<li><p>In Viewpoint Management, Database &gt; Settings &gt; Application, 
	 set Security Model = Services Office Model [8].</p></li>
	<li><p>Set up the following in Configuration &gt; Users &amp; Security:</p></li>
	<li class="hcp2"><ul class="hcp1">
		<li><p>User Roles and Services Provided</p></li>
		<li><p>User Groups</p></li>
		<li><p>Administrator Groups</p></li>
		<li><p>Users - ensure that the right File Access option is selected</p></li>
	</ul></li>
	<li><p>Set the appropriate <a class="dropspot" href="javascript:TextPopup(this)" id="a2">Service

	 &gt; Settings &gt; Customise &gt; Windows Menu.</p>

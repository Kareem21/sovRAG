<h1>System Defaults - General/Master File</h1>
<p>The defaults in this screen apply to the environment and Master Files.</p>
<h6 class="Heading8">&#160;</h6>
<p class="FldExplain">Coding Method for Master File</p>
<p>Specify the coding method for new Master Files from the system standards. 
 Viewpoint recommends that you carefully consider which coding system you 
 will use before you start using the system because an unsuitable coding 
 system can have serious “knock-on” effects which are time consuming to 
 solve. To avoid problems at a later date, treat your database as you would 
 treat a new filing cabinet: instead of throwing everything in without 
 labelling the sections, choose a coding system which will maximize the 
 efficiency of the system no matter how many files you put in. Note that 
 the code accepts alphanumeric characters (A-Z and 0-9) only except if 
 you enable the option 'Allow Master File Coding in Special Characters'.</p>
<ul class="hcp1">
	<li><p>Alpha 4 Characters Automatic [1] - Automatically assigned four-character 
	 code that is derived from the Master File name. For example: CASE.</p></li>
	<li><p>Alpha 6 + Sequence + MF Type [3] - Suggested code made up of 
	 six characters derived from the name followed by three numeric characters 
	 beginning with 001 and ending with the Master File type. This code 
	 can be amended as long as the final code is ten characters long. For 
	 example: CASEYL001C.</p></li>
	<li><p>Alpha 6 Characters Automatic [2] - Automatically assigned six-character 
	 code that is derived from the Master File name. For example: CASEYL</p></li>

	</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p class="FldExplain">Status - New Master File</p>
<p>Select the default status for new Master Files. This is useful if your 
 procedures require that new Master Files be approved, or set to Active, 
 by a Manager. Create your Master File status in the Master File Status 
 [RECS] lookup value table.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p class="FldExplain">Omit Country with Address</p>
<p>Use this function if you want to omit the country in an address. For 
 example, if you are in Isle of Man and do not require Isle of Man addresses 
 to display 'Isle of Man' in forms, then enter Isle of Man [IM] in this 
 field.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p class="FldExplain">Default Language</p>
<p>Select the default language for your system. This sets the default invoice 
 language to be used for clients and the default language in <a href="Document_Templates.htm" 
	 style="background-color: Transparent;">Document Templates</a>.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p class="FldExplain">Environment Name</p>
<p>This field is not editable. User is required to edit Environment Name

 application - ENVIND key.</p>

		<li><p>Click to select the colour.</p></li>
		<li><p>Click Add to Custom Colors.</p></li>
	</ol>
</div>
<p>In System Settings, it is stored under VPCROSS application - ENVINC 
 key.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p class="FldExplain">Maximum Master File Search Returns</p>
<p>The value here limits the number of records for Master File search. 
 By default, the value is 'Nil' which means no limit. In System Settings, 
 it is stored under VPCROSS application - MAXSRH key.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p class="FldExplain">Display Search Result</p>
<p>When performing a Master File search, if the results exceeds the value 
 set in 'Maximum Master File Search Returns', nothing will be displayed. 
 If you tick this option, then it will display the maximum number of records 
 for the search with a message informing you that the search results exceeds 
 the maximum limit set.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p class="FldExplain">Maximum Grid Records</p>
<p>The value here limits the number of records to be loaded to grids throughout 
 Viewpoint. The default is 5000 records but this can be changed according 
 to your needs. Set the value to 0 to disable the limit.</p>
<p><span class="hcp3">Note</span>: Loading 
 of records will take time and processing power.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p class="FldExplain">Add-ins/Local Agent Port Range</p>
<p>The value here limits the TCP Binding Port number range for Add-ins 
 and Local Agent connection to Viewpoint. Enter the port range in the format 
 of x-y, where x is the minimum port number and y is the maximum port number. 
 The port range has to be within 1025 to 65535. Viewpoint will only establish 
 the connection based on the specified port range. The port number for 
 Add-ins and Local Agent will be randomised with each receiving a different 
 number.</p>
<p>The entered value will be stored in the System Settings, under VPCROSS 
 application - PORTRG key.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<h4>Navigation Menu Access</h4>
<p>The options below relate to the navigation menu.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p class="FldExplain">Hide Master File Relations for Entities</p>

<p>&#160;</p>
<p class="FldExplain">Hide Safe Custody Register for Non-Entities</p>
<p>Tick this to hide the Safe Custody Register in the Documents menu if

<h4>Generation of Documents</h4>

<p class="FldExplain">Archive by Master File</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="font-style: normal;">This is used when you 
 do not use Document Management but want to archive Viewpoint forms by 
 Master File. When ticked, the generated forms will be stored in individual 
 files in \\server\ViewPoint\Archive\MFILES. Users will be able to view 
 the stored documents by selecting Filing Cabinets in the right-click mouse 
 menu or clicking Documents from the Ribbon in Viewpoint - Home and File 
 Maintenance screens. For more information, refer to <a href="../Administrator/Filing_Cabinet_for_Master_File.htm">Filing 
 Cabinet for Master File</a>.</p>

 Management component, untick this option and tick the 'Integrate DM for 
 generated documents' in <a href="System_Defaults_-_Document_Management.htm">System 
 Defaults &gt; Document Management</a>. This will give you the Document 
 Management option in your right-click mouse menu and change the location 
 for generated forms to \\server\ViewPoint\Archives. To be able to access 
 previously-generated forms in \\server\ViewPoint\Archive\MFILES, the files 
 need to be moved to \\server\ViewPoint\Archives and renamed. Please contact 
 your Viewpoint support for assistance on this.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="font-style: normal;"><span class="hcp3">Note</span>: 
 When the user has converted the environment to the Cloud Solution, system 
 will disable the 'Archive by Master File' option due to the generated 
 forms and letters in the Cloud Solution will be saved into the DocStore 
 database. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="font-style: normal;">The user can retrieve 
 the previous saved forms and letters from the server \Archive\MFILES folder.</p>

<h4>Other Options</h4>
<p class="FldExplain">Identity Details Checked for Officer/Share/UBO</p>

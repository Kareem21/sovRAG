<h1>System Defaults - Entity/BPM</h1>
<p>The defaults for the Entity and Forms are set up here. Before you proceed, 
 ensure that you have set up the Master File for the Presenter, and codes 
 for the various jurisdictions. Viewpoint comes pre-installed with two-letter 
 ISO-standard codes for most countries. However, if the country code you 
 need is not in the list, you can create it in the Country Codes [CNTR] 
 lookup table.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p class="FldExplain">Jurisdiction</p>
<p>Enter the default country for the Form Library. Each time you open the 
 form library, the jurisdiction will automatically default to the country 
 entered here.</p>

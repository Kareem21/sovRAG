<h1>Approval Cards in Workflow</h1>
<p>Checklist item configured with the Approval Card field type is used 
 to prevent users from going to the next step without approval.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<h2>Approving a Step</h2>
<p>Approving a step can be done in Workflows screen and Workflow Steps 
 screen if the user has access to these screens.</p>
<ol class="hcp1">
	<li><p>In Viewpoint - Home, go to To Do &gt; Overview &gt; To Do Summary 
	 &gt; Jobs – Workflows/Jobs – Workflow Steps or To Do &gt; Action Items 
	 &gt; Workflows/Workflow Steps screen.</p></li>
	<li><p>Select the workflow to update.</p></li>
	<li><p>Click Open. In the opened workflow, the status and approval 
	 Id of the item will be seen.</p></li>
	<li><p>Click Approval.</p></li>
	<li><p>The Approval screen is shown on the left panel and the checklist 
	 items in the step are shown on the right panel. Users can copy the 
	 information in the checklist items and paste them in the Note field 
	 in the Approval screen.</p></li>
	<li><p>Users can view multiple tabs on the right panel if there is 
	 a checklist item configured as Go to Screen field type. The information 
	 shown can also be copied and pasted in the Note field in the Approval 
	 screen. </p></li>
	<li><p>In the Approval screen, the details of the approval such as 
	 the Approval ID, number of approvals required, and users who are authorised 
	 to approve will be shown.</p></li>
	<li><p>Click Approve. </p></li>
</ol>
<p>The status of an approved approval card will change from 'Pending Approval' 
 to 'Approved and Completed'. </p>

<p>&#160;</p>
<p><span class="hcp3">Note:</span> The 
 approval details can also be viewed in the print preview screen of the 
 workflow step containing the approval card by clicking on the ‘Print Workflow’ 
 or ‘Print Step’ ribbon. &#160;</p>
<p>Once a step has been approved, it is considered as completed so the 
 next step becomes the current step.</p>
<p>If the approver does not have access to either the Workflows or Workflow 
 Steps screen, the approving is to be done through Approvals screen.</p>
<ol class="hcp1">
	<li><p>In Viewpoint - Home, go to To Do &gt; Action Items &gt; Approvals 
	 screen.</p></li>
	<li><p>Select the workflow step to approve.</p></li>
	<li><p>Click Go to.</p></li>
	<li><p>In the opened workflow, click Approval to open the Approval 
	 screen.</p></li>
</ol>
<p><span class="hcp3">Note:</span> The 
 workflow step may require multiple approvers. In this case, all the approvers 
 must perform the approval before the step is considered as complete.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<h2>Undoing Step Approval</h2>
<p>You can click on ‘Undo Approve’ to undo the approval. This is applicable 
 only when more than one approval is required. After undoing the approval, 
 you will need to re-approve the Approval Card.</p>

<p><img src="../Image12.png" alt="" border="0" class="hcp2"></p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<h2>Rejecting a Step</h2>
<p>To reject a workflow step, ensure that you specify the reason in the 
 Note field and then click Reject. This may prompt the New Task screen 
 for a task to be created for the rejection. If so, review t he task details 
 and click Update. </p>
<p><span class="hcp3">Note</span>: Whether 
 a task is created for rejecting a step or not depends on the configuration 
 of your environment. </p>
<p>&#160;<img src="../Image13.png" alt="" border="0" class="hcp2"></p>
<p>The rejection task will be placed below the workflow item. If the workflow 
 step is rejected for more than once, the task details of the latest record 
 will be first shown.</p>
<p><img src="../Image16.png" alt="" border="0" class="hcp2"></p>
<p>Once the task assigned have been completed, you will need to approve 
 the approval card again. In the approval screen, rejection details including 
 timestamp and the approvals are displayed chronologically. &#160;</p>
<p><img src="../image32.png" alt="" border="0" class="hcp2"></p>
<p>If there are two or more approval cards within the same workflow step, 
 rejecting a later approval card will void all earlier approvals where 
 the status will change from ‘Approved and Completed’ to ‘Pending Approval’. 
 You will need to approve the approval card again.</p>

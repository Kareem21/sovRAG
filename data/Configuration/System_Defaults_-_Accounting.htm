<h1>System Defaults - Accounting</h1>
<p>The defaults for Accounting are set up here.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p class="FldExplain">PM Accounting Journals</p>
<p>Select the format for the accounting journals in Practice Management 
 from system standards. &#160;</p>
<ul class="hcp1">
	<li><p>None [0] - No postings are made, and no journals are kept.</p></li>
	<li><p>PM Journals [1] - Journals are generated in Practice Manager 
	 and you can create an Excel report on these journals for manual import 
	 or entry into a third party accounting software.</p></li>
	<li><p>CA Journals RC [2] - Journals are posted to the Revenue Entity's 
	 account(s) only. This option is used when you use Accounting for internal 
	 (in-house) accounts, but not for your Client's accounts.</p></li>
	<li><p>CA Journals CE [4] - Journal are posted to the Client's Entity 
	 account(s) only. This option is used when you keep accounts for the 
	 Client's entities, and do not use Accounting for your internal (in-house) 
	 accounts.</p></li>
	<li><p>CA Journals RC + CE [6] - Journals are posted to the Revenue 
	 Entity's account(s) as well as the Client's accounts.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p class="FldExplain">Generate Journals Automatically</p>
<p>Tick this option if you want the journals created in Practice Management&#160;to 
 be generated automatically in Accounting. If this option is not ticked, 
 you can manually post journals to Accounting. You can find out more in 
 the Practice Management and Accounting help files.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p class="FldExplain">Post Client File Journal as Draft</p>
<p>Tick this option to post invoices and receipts to Accounting as draft 
 journal for client file. </p>
<p>This requires the Draft Journals option to be ticked in File Maintenance 
 &gt; Accounting &gt; Account File &gt; General &gt; Settings. Otherwise, 
 it will still post as Final. </p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p class="FldExplain">Global Reporting Currency</p>
<p>Select the reporting currency for global reports. Global reports can 
 be accessed from Viewpoint - Home screen through the Reporting section.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p class="FldExplain">Reporting Location</p>
<p>Enter the default location for global reports.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p class="FldExplain">Disable use of Line Reference Date</p>
<p>Tick this option if you want to disable the use of the Line Reference 
 Date. Once disabled, you will not be able to enter a Line Date during 
 journal entry. In Journal Quick Entry – Entries Tab, the ribbon button 
 ‘Line Date’ will not be shown and the grid column ‘Line Date’ will be 
 hidden.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p class="FldExplain">Auto Calculate Reverse Exchange Rate</p>
<p>This option allows Accounting to automatically calculate the reverse 
 exchange rate to the one entered into the Exchange Rates Master. For example, 
 if the exchange rate for USD to Pound Sterling is entered into the system, 
 it will automatically calculate the rate for Pound Sterling to USD. Select 
 either this option, or the Use 'Triangular/Cross' Exchange Rates option 
 (see below) to calculate the exchange rate. You should not use both at 
 the same time.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p class="FldExplain">Use 'Triangular/Cross' Exchange Rates</p>
<p>When ticked, the system will automatically calculate the exchange rate 
 between two currencies if there are already rates available for these 
 two currencies against a third currency. For example, if the rate between 
 Euro and USD, and Pound Sterling and Euro are available, Viewpoint will 
 be able to calculate the rate between USD and Pound Sterling. Select either 
 this option, or the Auto Calculate Reverse Exchange Rate option (see above) 
 to calculate the exchange rate. You should not use both at the same time.</p>
<ol style="list-style: decimal;">
	<li><p>Direct rate (A &#8594; B); or</p></li>
	<li><p>Inverse of the direct rate from B to A (1/B &#8594; A); or</p></li>
	<li><p>Indirect rate through another currency (C), where the priority 
	 is the most recent rate (A &#8594; C x C &#8594; B); or</p></li>
	<li><p>As per 3, but using the inverse rate (A &#8594; C x 1/(B &#8594;C))</p></li>
</ol>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">Note</span>:</p>
<ul class="hcp1">
	<li><p>The program will search for the most recent rate ON/BEFORE the 
	 journal date.</p></li>
	<li><p>For 3 and 4, the rates (of A &#8594; C and C &#8594; B) must be on the same 
	 date.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>If you opt for this method after having used the Auto Calculate Reverse 
 Exchange Rate option (see above) prior to this, then it is advisable to 
 clean up the Exchange Rates Master and delete unused exchange rate currency 
 combinations, i.e. those which you no longer update, to avoid referring 
 to them and returning old or outdated rates. If the old rates are left 
 as is, Viewpoint could pick them up as it will first look for the direct 
 rate - even though it might be years old. We suggest that you have only 
 the exchange rates for your currency of choice (e.g. GBP -&gt;&lt;Currencies&gt;) 
 to avoid confusion. Note that if you do a backdated valuation, Viewpoint 
 will use the cross rates.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p class="FldExplain">Disable Automatic Tax Entries</p>
<p>Tick this if you DO NOT want a tax journal line to be automatically 
 created in the general journal and journal script screens when a tax account 
 is selected or specified in a journal line.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p class="FldExplain">Allow Editing of Automatic Tax Entries</p>
<p>Tick this option to allow editing of tax amount in Journal Quick Entries 
 and Journal Script.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p class="FldExplain">Split Authority for Draft &amp; Posting</p>
<p>If the Draft Journals function is used in the Account File, when this 
 option is ticked, the program will not allow the user who last edited 
 a draft journal to post it. <i style="font-style: normal;">This option 
 is only applicable on ‘Post as Final’.</i></p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p class="FldExplain">Enforce Credit Limit for Sub-ledgers</p>
<p>Tick the check box if you want to enforce the credit limit for the Creditor 
 and Bank Account sub-ledgers. You will not be able to post any more journals 
 to the sub-ledger when you reach the credit limit.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p class="FldExplain">Line Reference Date Must be in Posting Window</p>
<p>This option is ticked if you want to validate that the Line Reference 
 date is within the posting period.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p class="FldExplain">Show Assigned Journal No. on Posting</p>
<p>Tick this to show the assigned Journal Number on posting. This does 
 not apply to Journal Quick Entry.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p class="FldExplain">Roll Year-End: Warn for Un-posted Transactions</p>
<p>Tick this if you want to be informed of un-posted transactions such 
 as invoices, receipts, payments or draft journals when you roll the year-end.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p class="FldExplain">Use Unit Codes Default Values in Journal Entry</p>
<p>Tick this to apply default values for Unit Codes to Journal entry screen.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p class="FldExplain">Include Unrealised Revaluation in Cost Calculations</p>
<p>When this option is ticked, transactions assigned to the Unrealised 
 Revaluation movement code ending with 'U'(*U) will be included in the 
 disposal cost calculation when using journal scripts, depending on the 
 Security Valuation method used.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p class="FldExplain">Command buttons:</p>
<p>Click on the relevant command button to perform the necessary.</p>

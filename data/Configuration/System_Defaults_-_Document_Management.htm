<h1>System Defaults - Document Management</h1>
<p>The settings for Document Management are defined here.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p class="FldExplain">Document Store</p>
<p>Enter or browse to the folder path where documents are to be stored. 
 Use relative paths to assign drives (for example: \\server\Viewpoint\DocStore). 
 Special attention must be paid when Viewpoint programs are installed on 
 a server and workstations are used to run the programs. To assign drives, 
 relative paths must be used to ensure that the programs will properly 
 run from the workstations. Therefore, Viewpoint recommends using the network 
 name instead of the assigned drive name.</p>
<p>Folder path validation is disabled when Viewpoint Connect is set up 
 in Cloud Solution ('Enabled Viewpoint Connect to connect through Application 
 Server' is ticked in Viewpoint Management with Application Server running).</p>
<p><span class="hcp1">Note</span>: If 
 you have moved your Document Store to the SQL database, then this field 
 will show ;[DMSTORAGE].</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p class="FldExplain">Audit Trail Folder</p>
<p>Enter or browse to the path where scanned batches and the audit trail 
 are stored. Folder path validation is disabled when Viewpoint Connect 
 is set up in Cloud Solution ('Enabled Viewpoint Connect to connect through 
 Application Server' is ticked in Viewpoint Management with Application 
 Server running).</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p class="FldExplain">Holder Security</p>

<h1>System Defaults - Time and Disbursements</h1>
<p>The defaults for Time and Disbursements are set up here.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p class="FldExplain">Time Unit of Measure</p>
<p>This is the standard value in which all time entries are entered. For 
 example, if you choose Hour(s) [1], one unit of time will represent one 
 hour and if you wish to enter ten minutes you must enter it as one sixth 
 of a unit or 0.16. The options available as per below:</p>
<ul class="hcp1">
	<li class="hcp2">Hour(s) [1]</li>
	<li class="hcp2">Minute(s) [2]</li>
	<li class="hcp2">10 Minute(s) [3]</li>
	<li class="hcp2">6 Minute(s) [4]</li>
	<li class="hcp2">15 Minute(s) [5]</li>
	<li class="hcp2">5 Minute(s) [6]</li>
</ul>
<p><span class="hcp3">Note:</span> The 
 time unit of measure cannot be changed once the system has been set up 
 so it is vital that you consider your choice carefully and select the 
 most appropriate unit from the system standards.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p class="FldExplain">Blocked Matters - Time Service</p>
<p>This is to set a Time - Administrator Rate [TA] service code for time 
 entries that will be logged for Matters with status 2 and 3.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<h4>Timesheet - Default Service for:</h4>
<p class="FldExplain">Public Holiday</p>
<p>This is to set the default service for the time entry that will be created 
 when you click Public Holiday in the Timesheet screen.</p>
<p><span class="hcp3">Note</span>: If 
 there is no service specified, the Public Holiday command button will 
 not be available.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p class="FldExplain">Leave</p>
<p>This is to set the default service for the time entry that will be created 
 when you click Leave in the Timesheet screen.</p>
<p><span class="hcp3">Note</span>: If 
 there is no service specified, the Leave command button will not be available.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p class="FldExplain">Internal Meeting</p>
<p>This is to set the default service for the time entry that will be created 
 when you click Internal Meetings in the Timesheet screen.</p>
<p><span class="hcp3">Note</span>: If 
 there is no service specified, the Internal Meetings command button will 
 not be available.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<h4>Time</h4>
<p class="FldExplain">Allow All Services for Time Entry</p>
<p>Tick to allow all services created to be used for Time Entry. The option 
 CANNOT be used in conjunction with the option Link Services to Matter 
 Types (see above). If you tick this, then services in the Disbursement 
 service class are charged at Administrator rate when entered in the Time 
 Entry screen.</p>
<p class="SeeAlso">See also:</p>
<ul class="hcp1">
	<li><p><a href="Service_Rates.htm">Service Rates</a></p></li>
</ul>
<h6 class="Heading8">&#160;</h6>
<p class="FldExplain">Use Recurring Services for Time Entries</p>
<p>Tick to enable the selection of recurring fees for Time entries. This 
 will limit the services that the user can select in Time entries to the 
 recurring fees set up for the Billing File. Services other than those 
 in the 'Time' service class will be charged at the prevailing administrator 
 rate, while the Time - Non Chargeable [TN] services will not be charged, 
 as normal. You will need to set the Number of Units and Unit Price to 
 0 when setting up the services in the Recurring Fees screen in Sales Ledger. 
 This is done automatically if the Sales Ledger in <a href="Service_Master.htm">Service 
 Master</a> is unticked.</p>
<p class="SeeAlso">See also:</p>
<ul class="hcp1">
	<li><p><a href="../Practice_Manager/Recurring_Fees_-_Time_and_Disbursement_Services.htm">Recurring 
	 Fees - Time and Disbursement Services</a></p></li>
</ul>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p class="FldExplain">Use Recurring Services for Time Postings</p>
<p>This option can be used together with the option 'Use Recurring Services 
 for Time Entries'.</p>
<p>When 'Use Recurring Services for Time Entries' and 'Use Recurring Services 
 for Time Posting' options are ticked:</p>
<ul class="hcp1">
	<li><p>users can choose to enter Time services in either Recurring 
	 Fees or Transaction Charging screen.</p></li>
	<li><p>users would use Recurring Fees and Transaction Charging when 
	 they want to separate the authority i.e. Finances to set up Recurring 
	 Fees and Administrators to set up Transaction Charging.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>If this option is not ticked, the draft invoice will include time entries 
 that are within the date range specified for the Posting of WIP. The Date 
 from and Date to for the invoice line will also follow the date range 
 specified for the Posting of WIP.</p>
<p>If ticked, draft invoices prepared using Posting of WIP will:</p>
<ul class="hcp1">
	<li><p>include approved time entries dated BEFORE the Next Invoicing 
	 Due set for the service in the Recurring Fees screen.</p></li>
	<li><p>NOT include time entries that are AFTER the Next Invoicing Due 
	 set for the service in the Recurring Fees screen.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>In this case, if the Entry Date is earlier than Recurring Fees From 
 Date, the system will roll one period before (based on Charge Frequency) 
 of Recurring Fees From Date and assign the date as From Date of the Invoice 
 Line.</p>
<p>[Date - from] = [Recurring Fees From Date] - [Charge per]</p>
<p><span class="hcp4">Example:</span> When Recurring Fees 
 From Date = 01 Jan 2019, Charge per = Annually, and earliest time entry 
 is dated 01 Jan 2018, the [Date - from] will be 01 Jan 2018.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>If the Entry Date is equal to or later than Recurring Fees From Date, 
 the system will assign Recurring Fees From Date as the From Date of the 
 Invoice Line.</p>
<p><span class="hcp4">Example:</span> When Recurring Fees 
 From Date = 01 Jan 2019, Charge per = Annually, and earliest time entry 
 is dated 03 Jan 2019, the [Date - from] will be 01 Jan 2019.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>If Next Invoicing Due of Recurring Fees is equal to or earlier then 
 Recurring Fees To Date, the system will assign the Earliest Entry Date 
 as the From Date of the Invoice Line.</p>
<p><span class="hcp4">Example:</span> When Recurring Fees 
 To Date = 31 Dec 2019, Recurring Fees Next Invoicing Due = 01 Jan 2019, 
 earliest time entry is dated 31 Dec 2018, the [Date - from] will be 31 
 Dec 2018.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p class="FldExplain">Allow Special Function on Approved Time</p>
<p>This option will apply the Special function on time entries that have 
 been approved. If this option is not ticked, the Special function can 
 only be applied on time entries that have not been approved.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p class="FldExplain">Enable Analysis Code</p>
<p>Tick this to enable the Analysis Code field in Time Entries screen. 
 This option is useful if you need to further analyse the allocation of 
 time spent by users.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p class="FldExplain">Default Description with Analysis Code</p>
<p>Tick this to have the description for time entry default to the Analysis 
 Code's description.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p class="FldExplain">Set Administrator Rates by Rate Level</p>
<p>Tick this if you are using Rate Level instead of Administrator Rate. 
 You can create new Rate Level list in the Service Rate Admin Levels [SRAL] 
 lookup value table.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p class="FldExplain">Use Client Fee Agreement for Administrator Rates</p>
<p>Tick to apply rates in Client Fee Agreement for services of the service 
 class 'TA'.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p class="FldExplain">Use Budget &amp; Rates for Administrators</p>
<p>Tick this to allow different time rates to be set up for Billing Files. 
 The rates are to be set up in <a href="../Practice_Manager/Budget_&amp;_Rates.htm">Budget 
 &amp; Rates</a> screen.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p class="FldExplain">Hide Unit/Total Cost</p>
<p>Tick this to hide the fields 'Unit Cost' and 'Total Cost' in the Time 
 Entries screen.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p class="FldExplain">Disallow Negative Entry</p>
<p>Tick this option to disallow negative value for the total amount of 
 time entries. This option is not ticked by default.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p class="FldExplain">Disallow Entry when 'Time Charge Limit' Exceeded</p>
<p>Tick this to disallow time entries if it exceeds the limit set for the 
 <a href="../Practice_Manager/Matters.htm">Matter</a> or <a href="../Practice_Manager/Recurring_Fees_Setup.htm">Recurring 
 Fees</a> (whichever limit that exceeds first). If unticked, the time entry 
 can still be added.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p class="FldExplain">Show 'Time Clocks' in Tools</p>
<p>Tick this to enable Time Clocks tab in Tools. This will be seen only 
 in Viewpoint - Home.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<h4>Time Management</h4>
<p class="FldExplain">Enable Time Management</p>
<p>Tick this to enable the Time Management feature. This will display the 
 <a href="../Practice_Manager/Timesheet_-_Summary.htm">Summary</a> folder 
 in Timesheet screen and the date selection will default to the current 
 week. If this option is not ticked, date validation for the time entries 
 will use the dates for WIP Time in <a href="../Practice_Manager/Posting_control_settings.htm">Posting 
 Control Settings</a>.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p class="FldExplain">Create Two Timesheets when Month Ends on a Weekday</p>
<p>Tick this to create two timesheets for the week instead of one. This 
 applies only when the end of the month falls on a weekday and the start 
 of the next month is also a weekday. Both timesheets will have the same 
 week number e.g.</p>
<ul class="hcp1">
	<li><p>49-2015A (period from 30/11/2015 to 30/11/2015)</p></li>
	<li><p>49-2015B (period from 1/12/2015 to 6/12/2015)</p></li>
</ul>
<p class="FldExplain">Approve Time Entries on Timesheet Approval</p>
<p>Tick this to have related time entries approved when the timesheet is 
 approved. This removes the need to approve the time entries separately.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p class="FldExplain">Require Approval for Weekly Timesheet</p>
<p>Tick this if administrators are required to submit their timesheet for 
 approval. This will set the timesheet status to 'Waiting for Approval' 
 after submission. If this is not ticked, the timesheet will be automatically 
 approved and closed.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<h4>Disbursement</h4>
<p class="FldExplain">Use Recurring Services for Disbursement Entries</p>
<p>Tick to enable the selection of recurring fees for Disbursement entries. 
 This will limit the services that the user can select in Disbursement 
 entries to the recurring fees set up for the Billing File. You will need 
 to set the Number of Units and Unit Price to 0 when setting up the services 
 in the Recurring Fees screen in Sales Ledger. This is done automatically 
 if the Sales Ledger in <a href="Service_Master.htm">Service Master</a> 
 is unticked.</p>
<p class="SeeAlso">See also:</p>
<ul class="hcp1">
	<li><p><a href="../Practice_Manager/Recurring_Fees_-_Time_and_Disbursement_Services.htm">Recurring 
	 Fees - Time and Disbursement Services</a></p></li>
</ul>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p class="FldExplain">Use Recurring Services for Disbursement Postings</p>
<p class="Heading8">This option can be used together with the option 'Use 
 Recurring Services for Disbursement Entries'.</p>
<p>When 'Use Recurring Services for Disbursement Entries' and 'Use Recurring 
 Services for Disbursement Posting' options are ticked:</p>
<ul class="hcp1">
	<li><p>users can choose to enter Disbursement services in either Recurring 
	 Fees or Transaction Charging screen.</p></li>
	<li><p>users would use Recurring Fees and Transaction Charging when 
	 they want to separate the authority i.e. Finances to set up Recurring 
	 Fees and Administrators to set up Transaction Charging.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>If this option is not ticked, the draft invoice will include disbursement 
 entries that are within the date range specified for the Posting of WIP. 
 The Date from and Date to for the invoice line will also follow the date 
 range specified for the Posting of WIP.</p>
<p>If ticked, draft invoices prepared using Posting of WIP will:</p>
<ul class="hcp1">
	<li><p>include approved disbursement entries dated BEFORE the Next 
	 Invoicing Due set for the service in the Recurring Fees screen.</p></li>
	<li><p>NOT include disbursement entries that are AFTER the Next Invoicing 
	 Due set for the service in the Recurring Fees screen.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>In this case, if the Entry Date is earlier than Recurring Fees From 
 Date, the system will roll one period before (based on Charge Frequency) 
 of Recurring Fees From Date and assign the date as From Date of the Invoice 
 Line.</p>
<p>[Date - from] = [Recurring Fees From Date] - [Charge per]</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;">Example: When Recurring Fees From Date = 
 01 Jan 2019, Charge per = Annually, and earliest time entry is dated 01 
 Jan 2018, the [Date - from] will be 01 Jan 2018.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>If the Entry Date is equal to or later than Recurring Fees From Date, 
 the system will assign Recurring Fees From Date as the From Date of the 
 Invoice Line.</p>
<p><span class="hcp4">Example:</span> When Recurring Fees 
 From Date = 01 Jan 2019, Charge per = Annually, and earliest time entry 
 is dated 03 Jan 2019, the [Date - from] will be 01 Jan 2019.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>If Next Invoicing Due of Recurring Fees is equal to or earlier then 
 Recurring Fees To Date, the system will assign the Earliest Entry Date 
 as the From Date of the Invoice Line.</p>
<p><span class="hcp4">Example:</span> When Recurring Fees 
 To Date = 31 Dec 2019, Recurring Fees Next Invoicing Due = 01 Jan 2019, 
 earliest time entry is dated 31 Dec 2018, the [Date - from] will be 31 
 Dec 2018.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p class="FldExplain">D Class Services are Exclusively for Disbursements</p>
<p>Tick this to allow services of Service Classes starting with 'D' to 
 be selected ONLY when creating Disbursement entries.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p class="FldExplain">PO Recovery Code must exist as Recurring Fee</p>
<p>This option needs to be enabled with ‘Use Recurring Services for Disbursement 
 Entries’ to be effective. After enabled, when performing Add Recovery 
 in Purchase Ledger &gt; Invoicing &gt; Create/Edit Purchase Orders screen, 
 the PO Recovery Code by the Supplier Entity will be validated against 
 the Service Code of the Billing Entity Recurring Fee. The PO Recovery 
 Code by the Supplier Entity must exist as a Service Code of the Billing 
 Entity Recurring Fee in order for the Add Recovery to proceed.</p>

<p>Time and disbursements can only be posted to a draft invoice if they 
 are approved. If your approval system requires the approval of time spent 
 and disbursements entered before they are posted, tick the check box.

 by default.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p class="FldExplain">Reverse Time &amp; Disbursement on Cancel Invoice</p>
<p>Tick this if you want time and disbursement entries to be reversed when 
 you cancel an invoice. Posted time and disbursement entries will be offset 
 with negative entries with the same activity date as the original entries, 
 and new 'replacement' entries will be created in Time and Disbursements 
 with the same activity date as the original. If you cancel the posting

<h1>System Defaults - Practice Management</h1>
<p>The defaults for Practice Management are set up here.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p class="FldExplain">Reporting Currency</p>
<p>The reporting currency is the principal currency in which the system 
 reports and summarises financial numbers. You must ensure that you make 
 the correct choice when selecting your currency because it cannot be changed 
 once the system has been set up.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p class="FldExplain">Default Revenue Entity</p>
<p>Set the revenue entity to the most frequently used one, so that the 
 system defaults to this when creating a new Matter.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p class="FldExplain">Recharge - Default Service</p>
<p>The service specified in this field is the default for the <a class="dropspot" href="javascript:TextPopup(this)" id="a14">Recharge</a> 
 button in the Settlements screen. If the option 'Use Recurring Services 
 for Disbursement Entries' is enable but the specified service has not 
 been set up as a Recurring Fee for the Billing File, the charge will still 
 be created as a disbursement entry. However, you would not be able to 
 edit the service code of this disbursement entry.</p>
<div class="droptext" id="POPUP594079683" style="display: none;">
	<p>Recharge button is available when user clicks Receipt/Payment or 
	 Settle to Matter in the Settlements screen for Accounts Receivable.</p>
</div>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p class="FldExplain">File Review - Fee Date</p>
<p>Select the annual fee review date from the standards.</p>
<ul class="hcp1">

	 is due on the 1st of January every year.</p></li>
	<li><p>1st Month - current year [03] - Select this if you want the 
	 anniversary of the fee to be the 1st of the current month. For example, 
	 if you are running the fee review on 17 July, then the anniversary 
	 of the fee is 1 July of this year.</p></li>
	<li><p>1st Quarter - current year [02] - Select this if you want the 
	 anniversary of the fee to be the 1st of the current quarter. For example, 
	 if you are running the fee review on 17 September, then the anniversary 
	 of the fee is 1 July of this year.</p></li>
	<li><p>Anniversary incorp. - current year [05] - Select this if you 
	 want the anniversary of the fee to be the anniversary of the incorporation.</p></li>
	<li><p>Today's date [04] - Select this if you want the anniversary 
	 of the fee to be one year from today.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p class="FldExplain">Recurring Fee - Pro-rata Method</p>
<p>Select the method to pro-rate recurring fees.</p>
<ul class="hcp1">

 date for the new rate and the service has not been invoiced before.</p>
<p>Otherwise, the fee will be reviewed during the posting of the recurring

 in the Base Currency (‘Reporting Currency’) and invoiced in a different 
 currency. When this option is unticked, the invoice lines entered in the 
 Base Currency (‘Reporting Currency’) and invoiced in a different currency

 codes for different revenue entity. However, you must ensure that you

 Management to Accounting. The selections for Organisational Units are

<p>Tick this option to get the exchange rates based on the Journal date 
 for draft invoice in both Sales and Purchase and Payment/Receipts. Once 
 the exchange rate is defined in the draft invoice screen and if the user 
 changes the journal date during invoice posting window, the exchange rate 
 will not be recalculated based on the 'Journal Date' defined in the Sales 
 Invoice Posting/Supplier Invoice Posting window. It will only follow the 
 exchange rate in the draft invoice instead.<span style="display: inline	 ! important ;

<p><span class="hcp2">Note</span>: The 
 total amount due for recurring fee/time entries/disbursement entries might 
 differ during propose draft and prepare draft invoice stage in the Posting

 the propose draft stage, whereas the Journal date is already defined in 
 the prepare draft invoice stage.</p>

 is enabled in Configuration &gt; Settings &gt; System Defaults &gt; General/Master 
 File. </p>

<h1>System Defaults - Folders</h1>
<p>Set up the directory paths for form templates, user preferences, archive 
 folder and temporary files in this screen. This is to enable the system 
 to find the relevant files for all the functions it performs. If the paths 
 are not set up correctly you will encounter problems when working with 
 forms and reports. Please ensure that these paths are entered correctly 
 when the system is installed.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<h4>Drive Assignment</h4>
<p>Use relative paths to assign drives (for example: \\server\Viewpoint\Forms). 
 Special attention must be paid when Viewpoint programs are installed on 
 a server and workstations are used to run the programs. To assign drives, 
 relative paths must be used to ensure that the programs will properly 
 run from the workstations. Therefore, Viewpoint recommends using the network 
 name instead of the assigned drive name.</p>
<p>You can enter the paths or click on the Browse button to select the 
 path.</p>
<p>Folder path validation is disabled when Viewpoint Connect is set up 
 in Cloud Solution ('Enabled Viewpoint Connect to connect through Application 
 Server' is ticked in Viewpoint Management with Application Server running).</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p class="FldExplain">Template Forms</p>
<p>This is the location of the Forms folder, where templates required for 
 the generation of forms and reports are kept.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p class="FldExplain">User Preferences</p>
<p>This is the location of the User Prev folder, where grid layouts, Document 
 Management in-tray and batches, and the temporary .vps files that are 
 needed for document generation are kept.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p class="FldExplain">Save Customised Grid Layouts by User ID</p>
<p>Tick this option if you want to save the grid layouts by User ID. If 
 you save grid layouts by User ID, individual files containing grid settings 
 will be created for each user in the Viewpoint UserPrev folder.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p class="FldExplain">Archive Forms</p>
<p>This is the location of the Archive folder, where generated forms are 
 stored. If you tick the Archive by Master File check box in the General/Master 
 File tab (see below), forms are archived by the Master File number in 
 sub-folders that are created here. This is normally done if you do not 
 use the Document Management module.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p class="FldExplain">Temporary Files</p>
<p>This is the location of the Temp folder, where generated reports, excel 
 statements and temporary log files are kept.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p class="FldExplain">General Archive/Export</p>
<p>This is the location of the general or archive folder. When you perform 
 database archiving, the information is archived to this location.</p>
